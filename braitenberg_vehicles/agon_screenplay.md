# THE DISTANCE

**CHARACTERS:**

*   **HE (The Pursuer):** A man who cannot bear silence. He believes that if he stops talking, he will cease to exist. He is driven by a desperate need to connect, to merge, to collide.
*   **SHE (The Distancer):** A woman who cannot bear noise. She believes that if she is seen, she will be destroyed. She is driven by a desperate need to escape, to separate, to fade.

**SETTING:**

A bus stop on a road that stretches to the horizon in both directions. There is nothing else. The light is grey and flat.

---

**(The stage is silent. SHE sits on the bench, huddled in a large grey coat, staring at her feet. She is perfectly still.)**

**(HE enters from the left. He walks briskly, checking his watch, humming a loud, discordant tune. He sees HER. He stops. He smiles—a wide, predatory grin of friendliness.)**

**(He sits right next to her. Too close.)**

**HE**
(Loudly)
Wonderful day for it!

**(SHE flinches. She slides six inches to the right.)**

**HE**
(Sliding six inches to the right to close the gap)
The waiting, I mean. It’s the anticipation! The potential energy! Anything could arrive. A bus. A storm. A revelation!

**(SHE slides further away, almost off the bench.)**

**HE**
(Sliding again, pinning her to the edge)
You’re quiet. I like that. You’re a listener. A vessel! I can feel the vacuum you create. It pulls the words right out of me! It’s magnetic!

**SHE**
(Whispering, eyes closed)
Please.

**HE**
(Leaning in, shouting)
WHAT? I didn't catch that! Enunciate! Project! We have to bridge the gap! We have to fill the airwaves! If we don't vibrate the air, who will know we're here?

**SHE**
(Trembling)
Too... close.

**HE**
(Laughing hysterically)
Close? We’re miles apart! There are galaxies between us! But I can fix that! I can build a bridge of syllables! I can pave the road with vowels!

**(He starts talking faster, a manic stream of consciousness.)**

**HE**
Did you know that sound travels faster in water? We should be underwater! We could scream and it would be instant! A direct line! A collision of minds! BAM!

**(SHE stands up abruptly. She walks to the far side of the stage, turning her back to him.)**

**(HE stops. He blinks. The silence rushes back in. He looks terrified. He clutches his chest.)**

**HE**
(To himself, panicked)
It stopped. The signal. It stopped.

**(He looks at her back. She is far away. The stimulus is weak.)**

**HE**
(Quietly, unsure)
...hello?

**(SHE takes a deep breath. In the silence, she relaxes. She lowers her shoulders. She turns slightly, just a fraction.)**

**SHE**
(Softly)
It’s quiet now.

**(HE sees her turn. The signal returns. His eyes light up. The motor engages.)**

**HE**
(Jumping up)
YES! YOU SPOKE! WE’RE BACK! THE CONNECTION IS RE-ESTABLISHED!

**(He runs toward her. SHE gasps and covers her ears, shrinking away.)**

**HE**
( circling her, shouting)
DON’T YOU FEEL IT? THE ELECTRICITY? THE FRICTION? I AM RESONATING! I AM A BELL AND YOU ARE THE CLAPPER!

**SHE**
(Crying out)
Stop! Go away!

**HE**
I CAN’T! THE LOUDER YOU ARE, THE CLOSER I GET! IT’S PHYSICS! IT’S GRAVITY! PULL ME IN! CRASH INTO ME!

**(SHE drops to her knees, curling into a ball, hiding her face.)**

**SHE**
...nothing. Be nothing.

**(She goes completely silent and still. She becomes a rock.)**

**(HE stops running. He stands over her, panting. He waits for a reaction. There is none. He waves his hand in front of her face. Nothing.)**

**HE**
(Panting)
...are you... are you done?

**(Silence.)**

**HE**
(Deflated)
Oh.

**(He backs away slowly. He looks sad. He walks back to the bench and sits down, far away. He puts his head in his hands.)**

**HE**
(Whispering)
I just wanted... to be sure I was real.

**(Long pause. The wind blows. SHE hears the sadness in his voice. It is a low frequency. It is safe. She lifts her head. She looks at him across the stage.)**

**SHE**
(Tentatively)
...I’m real.

**(HE lifts his head. He sees her looking. He smiles. He stands up. He takes a deep breath, preparing to scream.)**

**(SHE sees him inhale. She flinches.)**

**(BLACKOUT)**
