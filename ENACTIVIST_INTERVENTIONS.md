## Room Setup Optimization Matrix

| Setup Element | Enactivist Function | Examples |
|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Physical space** | Creates sensorimotor field | Desk position, chair height, lighting angle |
| **Clothing/equipment** | Extends body schema | Headphones, specific shoes, work clothes, apron |
| **Posture protocol** | Establishes embodied stance | Standing for Cockpit, supine for Crypt, seated-upright for Chapel |
| **Tactile anchors** | Immediate grounding | Totem object, keyboard feel, tool grip, pen weight |
| **Temporal rhythm** | Creates autopoietic cycle | Pomodoros, timed blocks, ritual duration, 90-min checks |
| **Transition objects** | Marks body-state shift | Coffee ritual, walk to location, clothing change, threshold walk |

## The Core Four Interventions

### 1. The Threshold Walk
**Principle**: Embodied transition between rooms prevents cognitive carryover.

| From → To | Walk Protocol | Duration |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Foundation → Production | Walk to window, touch glass, return | 30 sec |
| Production → Foundation | Circle the room once, shake out hands | 45 sec |
| Any → Observatory | Walk to a different physical location before meta-cognition | 2 min |
| Social → Solo | Walk outside and back in, even briefly | 1 min |

**Room Examples**:
- **Crypt → Cockpit**: After rising from sensory deprivation, walk to the bathroom, splash water on face, then approach the workstation. Never go straight from bed to keyboard.
- **Dojo → Salon**: After skill drilling, walk around the block before engaging in intellectual debate. The body needs to shift from repetition-mode to dialogue-mode.
- **Mosh Pit → Clean Room**: After physical catharsis, a slow walk home allows the nervous system to downregulate before orderly tasks.

### 2. The 90-Minute Body Check
**Principle**: No room longer than 90 minutes without proprioceptive reset.

| Room Type | Body Check Protocol |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Seated Production** (Cockpit, Editor's Desk) | Stand, stretch overhead, 10 squats, return |
| **Standing Production** (Forge, Kitchen) | Sit, drink water, check feet/ankles |
| **Mental Rooms** (Map Room, Simulator) | Walk 100 steps, notice three physical sensations |
| **Social Rooms** (Salon, Team Huddle) | Change seating position, shift eye contact pattern |

**Room Examples**:
- **The Cockpit**: At minute 87, a soft chime sounds. You stand, stretch your hip flexors (sitting compresses them), do 10 shoulder rolls, then consciously re-commit: "I return to the Cockpit." Sit with fresh posture.
- **The Studio (Closed)**: Deep creative work can hyper-focus past body signals. Set a vibrating watch. At 90 minutes, even if flow is perfect, stand and look out the window for 3 minutes. The work will still be there.
- **The War Room**: Crisis mode burns out the body. Even during crunch, the 90-minute check is mandatory—drink water, stretch neck, notice if shoulders are lifted toward ears.

### 3. The Unified Posture System
**Principle**: Each wing has a default body position that primes the appropriate state.

| Wing | Default Posture | Variation Protocol |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **I. Foundation** | Supine or reclined | If seated, lean back 20+ degrees |
| **II. Administration** | Seated, spine vertical | Standing option for energy boost |
| **III. Machine Shop** | Standing or dynamic | Sitting only with elevated workstation |
| **IV. Wilderness** | Mobile/walking | Seated only when observing (Piazza) |
| **V. Forum** | Oriented toward others | Bodies angled 0-45° toward speaker |
| **VI. Observatory** | Variable but conscious | Choose and hold deliberately |

**Room Examples**:
- **The Morning Chapel (013)**: Begin seated at a clean desk, spine erect, both feet flat. This is Apollonian structure in the body. No slouching into bed-mode.
- **The Cockpit (025)**: Standing desk, ball of foot touching floor, slight forward lean. You are a pilot, not a passenger. If sitting, chair low enough that hips are above knees.
- **The Campfire (051)**: Seated on the ground or in a low chair, body relaxed but upright. Not slumped. The posture of listening is attentive but easeful.
- **The Bridge (061)**: Stand with weight balanced. You are surveying, not collapsing. If seated, hands visible on the table—the pose of a general reviewing maps.

### 4. The Sensory Signature
**Principle**: Each wing should have a distinct ambient character that primes the nervous system.

| Wing | Light | Sound | Temperature | Smell (Optional) |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Foundation** | Dim, warm | Silent or low drone | Warm (23-25°C) | Lavender, chamomile |
| **Administration** | Neutral, bright enough to read | Quiet, minimal | Neutral (21-22°C) | Clean, unscented |
| **Machine Shop** | Focused, task lighting | White noise or wordless music | Slightly cool (19-20°C) | Coffee, neutral |
| **Wilderness** | Variable, natural preferred | Loud acceptable | Variable, stimulating | Unpredictable |
| **Forum** | Warm, flattering | Others' voices are the sound | Comfortable for group | Shared food smells |
| **Observatory** | Low, high-contrast | Silent or minimal | Cool, alert (18-19°C) | None, clarity |

**Room Examples**:
- **The Crypt (001)**: Pitch black, earplugs or brown noise, weighted blanket (pressure = warmth substitute), no scent. The sensory field approaches zero.
- **The Forge (026)**: Bright work light over the task, rest of room dimmer. No music with lyrics. Temperature slightly cool to keep alert during physical work.
- **The Nightclub (038)**: Loud, bass-heavy, lights variable and colored. Temperature warm from bodies. The sensory overload is the point.
- **The Silent Retreat (069)**: Natural light only, no artificial sound, temperature on the cooler side. The absence of stimulation is itself the sensory signature.

## Room-Specific Interventions

### Wing I: Foundation

| Room | Intervention | Example Protocol |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **001 The Crypt** | *The Return-to-Body Exit* | Before standing, press palms together hard for 5 seconds. This creates interoceptive signal before re-entering sensory world. |
| **002 The Bath** | *Active Water Attention* | Every 3 minutes, move one limb slowly through the water, attending to the resistance and temperature differential. |
| **007 The Hearth** | *Fire Gazing with Peripheral Lock* | Soften eyes to peripheral vision while watching flame. Notice when focus narrows and re-soften. |
| **010 The Swamp** | *The Drift Walk* | If doomscrolling, do it while pacing slowly. Movement prevents total collapse into passive consumption. |

---

### Wing II: Administration

| Room | Intervention | Example Protocol |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **013 Morning Chapel** | *Standing Chapel Variant* | Do the trajectory-setting while standing at a window. Facing horizon = facing futures. |
| **015 The Map Room** | *Touch the Map* | Use physical paper or whiteboard. Your hand traces the territory. Screens flatten; surfaces embody. |
| **018 Editor's Desk** | *First-Pass Print* | Print the draft. Mark with pen. The hand-eye-paper loop catches what scrolling misses. |
| **023 Post Office** | *One-Finger Typing Test* | If you're processing email mindlessly, type one email with one finger only. This slows the habit loop and re-engages attention. |

---

### Wing III: Machine Shop

| Room | Intervention | Example Protocol |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **025 The Cockpit** | *Pre-Flight Physical Ritual* | Before first keystroke: crack knuckles, adjust chair height, take three breaths, say aloud what you will build. Body enters before mind. |
| **027 Studio (Closed)** | *The Locked Door Protocol* | Physically close the door. Turn off the phone. Put it in another room. The body knows when exits are sealed. |
| **034 The Dojo** | *Novel Variation Injection* | Every 10 reps, change one small parameter: tempo, angle, hand position. This maintains sensorimotor attention against mindless repetition. |
| **035 War Room** | *The Hydration Clock* | Every 30 minutes, drink a full glass of water. This forces bathroom breaks, which forces walking, which prevents crisis-mode body collapse. |

---

### Wing IV: Wilderness

| Room | Intervention | Example Protocol |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **038 Nightclub** | *Sobriety Windows* | First 45 minutes and last 30 minutes of dancing: water only. Full proprioceptive capacity for peak and exit. |
| **039 Mosh Pit** | *Pre-Pit Stretch* | 5 minutes of dynamic stretching before entering the pit. Warm muscles absorb impact better. Injury prevention is trust maintenance. |
| **041 Wilderness** | *No-Device Variant* | Leave phone in pack on airplane mode. Navigate by terrain, sun, intuition. Restore genuine wayfinding enacted through body. |
| **043 Sandbox** | *The Beginner's Hands* | When learning new hobby, spend first 10 minutes without tools—just hands on materials. Feel the medium before shaping it. |

---

### Wing V: Forum

| Room | Intervention | Example Protocol |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **050 The Salon** | *The Turned Body* | When someone speaks, turn your whole torso toward them, not just your head. Full body attention signals and enacts listening. |
| **051 Campfire** | *Physical Fire Mandatory* | Candles if indoors. Firepit if outdoors. No electric substitutes. The flicker pattern synchronizes attention pre-consciously. |
| **056 Confidant's Room** | *Walking Confidentiality* | Deep conversations work better walking side-by-side than sitting face-to-face. Shared direction = shared intimacy. |
| **058 Team Huddle** | *Standing Huddle* | No chairs. Standing creates urgency, brevity, and body-awareness. Meetings that could be emails become evident. |

---

### Wing VI: Observatory

| Room | Intervention | Example Protocol |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **061 The Bridge** | *Somatic State-Read* | Before choosing the next room, scan the body: energy in limbs? tension in shoulders? heaviness or lightness? Let the body vote on room selection. |
| **065 Simulator** | *Micro-Movement Visualization* | When simulating future scenario, allow the hands and face to make tiny movements corresponding to imagined actions. This couples imagination to motor system. |
| **069 Silent Retreat** | *Kinhin Mandatory* | At least 25% of silent retreat time in slow walking meditation. Pure sitting risks bodily deadening. |
| **071 The Totem** | *Temperature Attention* | When holding the Totem, notice its temperature changing from object-temperature to hand-temperature. This is enaction in miniature. |

## Implementation Priority

**Start with these three**:
1. **The Pre-Flight Ritual** (Cockpit, Dojo, Forge) — Create your physical entry sequence
2. **The 90-Minute Body Check** — Set timers for all extended-duration rooms
3. **The Walking Meeting** (Confidant, Team Huddle) — Default to movement for social rooms

**Then add**:
4. Standing variants for Administration rooms
5. Sensory signatures for each wing
6. Threshold walks between all room transitions
