# What's Next

> *Kiln: Where your world takes shape.*

---

## Kiln

Hyperframes is evolving into **Kiln** — an interactive, personalized experience where the 72 Rooms become *your* rooms.

### The Vision

Currently, Rooms are fixed compositions — curated audiobook experiences with predetermined variations and aesthetics. **Kiln** transforms this into something alive:

- **Your world as input** — Describe your current situation, tensions, or aspirations
- **Personalized rooms** — AI-generated variations tailored to your specific context
- **Interactive navigation** — Move between adjacent rooms based on what you need next
- **Evolving landscapes** — Rooms that change as you do

### How It Works

Kiln uses the underlying research frameworks — the 105+ sociological worlds, the variational techniques, the attention architectures — to generate *bespoke* narrative experiences:

1. **World diagnosis** — Identify which world(s) you currently inhabit
2. **Value alignment** — Understand what optimization means *for you*
3. **Room generation** — Create personalized audiobook variations
4. **Path suggestion** — Navigate to adjacent possible rooms

### From Consumption to Collaboration

Traditional audiobooks are monologues. Kiln is a conversation.

You're not just listening to philosophical ideas about attention, presence, or world-making. You're *using* them to craft your own experience — with AI as collaborator, not just narrator.
