# Audiobook Projects

The Hyperframes project explores generative narrative techniques through audiobook production. Each project applies **variational storytelling methods** to classical philosophical texts, creating multiple distinct variations on the same source material.

All audiobooks feature:
- AI-generated speech narration (ElevenLabs)
- Custom musical introductions tailored to each variation's aesthetic
- Literary structures adapted from classical forms (sonata, fugue, variations, etc.)

## Released Projects

### Variations on Reading
**Released:** December 2025  
**Concept:** "Variations on a Theme" — 10 variations exploring phenomenological and philosophical texts through different narrative lenses.

A collection of philosophical meditations transformed into audiobook variations, featuring readings from:
- Michel Serres (*The Five Senses*)
- Christopher Alexander (*The Nature of Order*)
- Georges Didi-Huberman (*The Man Who Walked Through Walls*)

Each variation explores the same conceptual territory with different:
- Narrative stances (first-person, second-person, third-person observer)
- Temporal frames (present tense, past tense, future projection)
- Ontological positions (materialist, phenomenological, mystical)

**Musical concepts**: Blues Rock, Psychedelic Soul, Slowcore/Sadcore  
**Location**: `book/coffee_shop_variations/`

### The NYC Subway Commuter
**Released:** December 2025  
**Concept:** Experimental audiobook exploring urban life and attention through multiple musical/aesthetic lenses.

Two distinct musical approaches:

#### Musique Concrète / Found Sound Edition
Pure processed subway sounds (no melodic instruments) — the city itself as the musical intro.

#### A Cappella / Human Voice Edition  
Human vocal textures, beatboxing, and layered harmonies creating the sonic landscape.

Both editions narrate the same phenomenological journey through the New York subway system, exploring themes of attention, urban space, and commuter consciousness.

**Location**: `book/nyc_subway_variations/`, `book/nyc_subway_acappella/`

### Tea Ceremony Variations
**Released:** December 2025  
**Concept:** Variations on the traditional Japanese tea ceremony, exploring ritual, temporality, and presence through different philosophical and narrative lenses.

The project applies the variational techniques framework to reimagine a single tea ceremony scenario through multiple perspectives — from Zen Buddhist mindfulness to algorithmic optimization, from historical reenactment to speculative future.

**Location**: `book/tea_ceremony_variations/`

## Production Methodology

All audiobooks are generated using a reproducible workflow:

1. **Narrative refactoring** — Classical philosophical texts are transformed into fluid, essayistic narratives suitable for speech
2. **Script generation** — Markdown texts optimized for speech synthesis with proper pacing and emphasis
3. **Music generation** — Custom 2-3 minute musical introductions using ElevenLabs Music API
4. **Speech synthesis** — High-quality, non-monotonous narration using ElevenLabs Speech API
5. **Audio merging** — Music intros concatenated with speech narration and silence padding

See the [Repository Guide](/guide) for detailed workflow documentation.

## Upcoming Projects

Future audiobook projects will explore:
- Additional world optimizations (see [Research](/research))
- Multi-voice podcast interview formats
- Interactive/branching narrative structures
- User-submitted world variations
