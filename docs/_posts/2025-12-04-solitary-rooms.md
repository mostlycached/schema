They live in cremation grounds. They sweep insects from their path before walking. They kill by profession and are touched by no one. Twenty occupations so specialized they become enclosures—rooms built not of walls but of practice, devotion, exclusion.

What does it feel like to live inside a vocation that separates you from the ordinary world?

Each track begins with music that evokes the room—desert wind for the Tuareg, silence and bells for the Jain, dark weight for the executioner—then a voice speaks to you. *You cross the dune. You hold the blade. You watch the glass cool.* Second person, present tense. These are not portraits to observe but rooms to enter.

The intent is phenomenological preparation. Once you've heard the Tuareg track, something in you understands: vast space can be claustrophobia. The desert horizon is a wall you can never reach. This is the paradox of the solitary room—the more specialized the practice, the smaller the world becomes.

Twenty rooms. Some are ancient (scribe, falconer, tea master). Some are dangerous (bullfighter, whaler, miner). Some are impossible to leave (bodybuilder, executioner, plague doctor). All of them are real, and all of them are prisons shaped like devotion.
