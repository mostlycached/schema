**Solitary Rooms** is now available on Bandcamp!

## The Project

This audiobook explores the phenomenology of solitude through the metaphor of rooms — each chapter a different kind of isolated space, from physical confinement to chosen withdrawal.

Drawing on the **Adjacent Rooms** framework, the narrative moves through different types of solitary experience:
- The **monk's cell** — chosen spiritual isolation
- The **prisoner's cell** — enforced confinement  
- The **studio** — creative solitude
- The **hospital room** — medical quarantine
- The **desert hermitage** — radical withdrawal

Each room reveals different dimensions of what it means to be alone.

## Musical Approach

Sparse, intimate musical introductions emphasize space and silence — the sonic equivalent of emptiness and withdrawal. Minimal instrumentation creates space for contemplation.

This project examines how physical and psychological isolation shapes perception, time, and self-understanding — exploring solitude not as mere absence, but as its own rich phenomenological territory.
