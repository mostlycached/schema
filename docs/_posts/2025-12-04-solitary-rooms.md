They live in cremation grounds. They sweep insects from their path before walking. They kill by profession and are touched by no one. Twenty occupations so specialized they become enclosures—rooms built not of walls but of practice, devotion, exclusion.

What does it feel like to live inside a vocation that separates you from the ordinary world?

Each track begins with music that evokes the room—desert wind for the Tuareg, silence and bells for the Jain, dark weight for the executioner—then a voice speaks to you. *You cross the dune. You hold the blade. You watch the glass cool.*

These are not portraits to observe. They are postures to try on. After listening to the Tuareg track, something shifts when you walk a long avenue—you feel how vast space can become its own enclosure, how the horizon can be a wall. After the watchmaker, your hands notice the weight of small things. After the executioner, you understand that some rooms are built by others looking away.

Each room you enter gives you a new way to move through the next. Twenty rooms, and then the twenty-first: your own life, made stranger by the practice.
