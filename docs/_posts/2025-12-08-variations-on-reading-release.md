**Variations on Reading** is now available on Bandcamp!

## About the Project

This audiobook explores phenomenological and philosophical texts through 10 distinct variations, each offering a different narrative lens on the same conceptual territory. The project draws from readings of:

- **Michel Serres** — *The Five Senses* (Chapter on climbing)
- **Christopher Alexander** — *The Nature of Order* (Fractal patterns and wholeness)
- **Georges Didi-Huberman** — *The Man Who Walked Through Walls* (Light and perception)

Each variation transforms the source material through different:
- **Narrative stances** (first-person, second-person, third-person observer)
- **Temporal frames** (present tense, past tense, future projection)
- **Ontological positions** (materialist, phenomenological, mystical)

## Musical Aesthetic

The audiobook features custom music introductions tailored to each variation's mood:
- **Blues Rock** for Serres' tactile, embodied climbing meditation
- **Psychedelic Soul** for Alexander's fractals and patterns
- **Slowcore/Sadcore** for Didi-Huberman's contemplative light studies

This project represents an experiment in **variational storytelling** — using the same source material to generate multiple perspectives, each revealing different facets of the philosophical concepts at play.
