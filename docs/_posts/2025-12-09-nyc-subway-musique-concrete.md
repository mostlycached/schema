**The NYC Subway Commuter (Musique Concrète Edition)** is now live on Bandcamp!

## The Concept

This audiobook explores urban consciousness through the lens of a daily subway commute. But rather than traditional musical introductions, each chapter begins with **pure processed subway sounds** — the city itself becomes the instrument.

**Musique Concrète** is the art of using recorded environmental sounds as musical material. In this edition:
- No melodic instruments
- No conventional harmony
- Only the rhythms, textures, and tones of the subway system
- Processed, layered, and sculpted into sonic introductions

## What You'll Hear

The narrative follows a commuter's phenomenological journey through:
- **Attention** and distraction in crowded spaces
- **Temporal experience** of waiting and movement
- **Urban space** as lived experience
- **Sensory overload** and withdrawal

Each chapter's musical intro uses authentic subway recordings — rumbling trains, announcements, turnstile clicks, platform ambience — transformed into soundscapes that mirror the inner experience of commuting.

The Musique Concrète approach strips away conventional musical comfort, leaving only the raw sonic texture of the urban environment — matching the phenomenological focus of the narrative itself.
