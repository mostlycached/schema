**Venn Vision** is now available on Bandcamp!

## About the Project

This audiobook explores the intersection of multiple conceptual frameworks — phenomenology, systems theory, and structural analysis — creating a narrative space where different modes of understanding overlap and illuminate each other.

The "Venn" in the title refers to the overlapping circles of different analytical lenses, revealing insights that emerge only in the intersections between perspectives.

## Musical Aesthetic

Custom musical introductions reflect the conceptual layering and intersection of ideas, with harmonic overlaps and rhythmic counterpoint mirroring the theoretical framework.

This project demonstrates how multiple analytical frameworks can be applied simultaneously to create richer, more nuanced understanding of complex phenomena.
