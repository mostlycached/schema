## Sociological & Phenomenological Worlds

An extensive framework analyzing contemporary and historical "worlds" through three simultaneous lenses:

1. **Phenomenological (Schutz)**: The subjective experience and shared meaning-making within a world
2. **Structural (Bourdieu)**: The power dynamics, capital forms, and habitus that shape behavior
3. **Systems (Luhmann)**: The functional purpose and communicative boundaries of the system

The framework encompasses over 105 distinct worlds, from novel formations like *The Algorithmic Gig Economy*, *The Twitch Livestreaming Ecosystem*, and *Reality Shifters* to long-lasting institutions like *The Monastic Order*, *The Emergency Room*, and *The Chess Club*.

Each world is characterized by:
- **Genealogy**: Historical, technological, or social origins
- **Tension**: Internal conflicts or external pressures driving evolution
- **Iteration**: Nuanced interventions that can shift the world's character
- **Inhabitants**: Key roles and actors within the system

## Attention Architecture

An architectural framework for understanding and implementing attention mechanisms, drawing on:
- Meta-cognitive attention layers
- Indexing and retrieval systems
- Critique and generation feedback loops

The architecture explores how attention operates not just as a mechanical filter, but as a multi-layered system involving scanning, meta-awareness, and dynamic indexing of experience.

## Braitenberg Vehicles & Diagrammatics

Research on Valentino Braitenberg's synthetic psychology approach, comparing it with other diagrammatic traditions (particularly Lautman's mathematical philosophy). Includes:

- Computational simulations of Braitenberg vehicles
- Narrative interpretations of vehicle behaviors (Aggressor, Coward, Explorer)
- Theoretical distinctions between different modes of diagrammatic reasoning

The work examines how simple mechanisms can generate complex, seemingly intentional behaviors — and what this reveals about the relationship between structure and interpretation.

## Intervention & Variational Techniques

A cataloged system of techniques for generating variations on existing worlds and narratives:

- **Metaphor**: Reframing elements through unexpected comparisons
- **Noise**: Amplifying or introducing signal disruptions
- **Defamiliarization**: Making the familiar strange
- **Dialectics**: Synthesizing opposing forces
- **Technology**: Examining how tools reshape experience
- **Somatic Intervention**: Focusing on embodied, physical dimensions

These techniques are applied across domains — from optimizing sociological worlds to generating narrative variations for audiobook production.

## Adjacent Rooms & Navigation

A theoretical framework for navigating between "pleasure rooms" — conceptual or physical spaces that provide distinct forms of satisfaction or experience. The framework addresses:

- The "adjacent possible" — which rooms are genuinely next steps vs. false adjacencies
- Signals for when to move (crisis, repetition, tension)
- The distinction between craft (Calvino) and being (Barthes)

## Collaboration & Usage

These research areas are actively evolving. The repository includes:
- Detailed markdown schemas and documentation
- Computational workflows (via `.agent/workflows/`)
- Audiobook production pipelines
- Generative tools for creating variations
