## The World Is Infinite If You Can Learn to See

Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone.

"But which is the stone that supports the bridge?" Kublai Khan asks.

"The bridge is not supported by one stone or another," Marco answers, "but by the line of the arch that they form."

Kublai Khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds: "Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to me."

Polo answers: "Without stones there is no arch."

I work on this project because I want to make my world wider, richer. And let that gesture reach out to make yours wider, richer too.

More specifically: I noticed that Calvino made Venice richer through *Invisible Cities*. And despite its universal appeal that every reader can enter those cities—underneath, it felt very much like Venice. His Venice. A Venice that became infinite through seeing.

I began to explore what my world looked like. In NYC, on the subway, in the coffee shop, I found new things that resonated. Old methods didn't always translate—the rhythms here are different, the density, the anonymity. But as I explored more through this project, something shifted. My solitude became richer. I got more curious about my neighbors. I started seeing the packed car as one variation, the empty car as another. I started recognizing the rooms. I began looking forward to tomorrows where worlds revealed themselves in cramped spaces.

I hope this is what these audiobooks bring to you too. Not looking at my worlds, but finding yours, made visible through the practice of framing and variation.

## On Using Generative AI

The text, music, and speech in these audiobooks were made with generative AI tools. My only contribution is to setup the scaffolding and nudge it in a direction that felt true to the soul of the project.

Art requires time, skill, and access. To commission a personalized audiobook—music matched to your morning, narration that speaks to *your* subway, *your* coffee shop—would require resources most people don't have, I don't have. Generative AI reduced this burden for me. It made it possible to create the art that speaks to *me*, not necessarily everyone.

These tools let me, one person build what probably requires a studio, a composer, a narrator, a producer. The result is imperfect—but imperfection isn't always bad. Mistakes have sometimes been generative. I intend to find more of them. And the machinic voice's particularity in content makes up for its roboticity in structure.

## On Music and Speech Together

One map offers clarity. Two maps reveal that maps themselves are necessary but insufficient.

Each audiobook begins with music and continues with speech—not because one mode is better, but because the combination produces something neither can alone. Listen to the same story twice in different modes. The first pass orients; the second defamiliarizes, just because it comes second. Something like a parallax effect emerges between them: a depth that neither the instrumental intro nor the spoken word creates independently.

This is still an open question for me. What exactly is that depth? How do you navigate through it? The music sets a tone the words cannot name. The words give shape the music cannot hold. Together they don't find the coordinates, they create a shimmering parallax that becomes a kind of continual pregnancy, something arriving more and more into itself, but the horizon keeps moving.

Future work will explore this further. For now, I offer both modes as an invitation: listen once, listen twice, and see what opens up.

## On Systems Used Loosely

The Hyperframes research framework behind these projects includes schemas, taxonomies, and systematic methods. Worlds are cataloged. Variations are enumerated. Lenses are named.

But systematic does not mean rigid. These systems are used in a loose fashion—as long as they work for you(or more pragmatically model interpretable). And "working" can only be judged by you, the listener, the reader. If the subway track makes you see the commute differently, it worked. If the tea ceremony track changes nothing, it didn't.

There is no authority here except recognition. Does it feel true? Does it work when you try it?
