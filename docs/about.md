## The World Is Infinite If You Can Learn to See

Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone.

"But which is the stone that supports the bridge?" Kublai Khan asks.

"The bridge is not supported by one stone or another," Marco answers, "but by the line of the arch that they form."

Kublai Khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds: "Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to me."

Polo answers: "Without stones there is no arch."

I began this project because I wanted to make my world richer.

More specifically: I noticed that Calvino made Venice richer through *Invisible Cities*. And despite its universal appeal—every reader can enter those cities—underneath, it felt very much like Venice. His Venice. A Venice that became infinite through seeing.

I began to explore what my world looked like. In NYC, on the subway, in the coffee shop, I found new things that resonated. Old methods didn't always translate—the rhythms here are different, the density, the anonymity. But as I explored more, something shifted. My solitude became richer. I got more curious about my neighbors. I started seeing the packed car as one variation, the empty car as another. I started recognizing the rooms.

I hope this is what these audiobooks bring to you too. Not my world, but yours—made visible through the practice of variation.

## On Using Generative AI

The text, music, and speech in these audiobooks were made with generative AI tools.

This is not an apology. It's an invitation.

Art has always required time, skill, and access. To commission a personalized audiobook—music matched to your morning, narration that speaks to *your* subway, *your* coffee shop—would require resources most people don't have. Generative AI reduces this burden. It makes it possible to create the art that speaks to *you*, not the art that speaks to everyone.

The goal is not to replace human creativity but to extend it. These tools let one person build what used to require a studio, a composer, a narrator, a producer. The result is imperfect. But imperfection is often the point.

## On Systems Used Loosely

The Hyperframes research framework behind these projects includes schemas, taxonomies, and systematic methods. Worlds are cataloged. Variations are enumerated. Lenses are named.

But systematic does not mean rigid. These systems are used in a loose fashion—as long as they hit the spot, as long as they *work*. And "working" can only be judged by you, the listener, the reader. If the subway track makes you see the commute differently, it worked. If the tea ceremony track changes nothing, it didn't.

There is no authority here except recognition. Does it feel true? Then it's true enough.
