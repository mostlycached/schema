## The World Is Infinite If You Can Learn to See

Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone.

"But which is the stone that supports the bridge?" Kublai Khan asks.

"The bridge is not supported by one stone or another," Marco answers, "but by the line of the arch that they form."

Kublai Khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds: "Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to me."

Polo answers: "Without stones there is no arch."

This is a project about learning to see arches.

The world you walk through every day—the subway, the coffee shop, the ritual, the occupation—is not one world but many. The packed car and the empty car are different rooms. The tea ceremony performed too fast and the one performed too slow are different ceremonies. The executioner and the tea master inhabit enclosures equally complete.

The audiobooks here are attempts to make these rooms visible. Music creates the phenomenological space; narration speaks to you directly—*you descend, you taste, you enter*—so that the next time you're in the subway or the coffee shop, something in you remembers. You recognize the variation. You see the arch.

## On Using Generative AI

The text, music, and speech in these audiobooks were made with generative AI tools.

This is not an apology. It's an invitation.

Art has always required time, skill, and access. To commission a personalized audiobook—music matched to your morning, narration that speaks to *your* subway, *your* coffee shop—would require resources most people don't have. Generative AI reduces this burden. It makes it possible to create the art that speaks to *you*, not the art that speaks to everyone.

The goal is not to replace human creativity but to extend it. These tools let one person build what used to require a studio, a composer, a narrator, a producer. The result is imperfect. But imperfection is often the point.

## On Systems Used Loosely

The Hyperframes research framework behind these projects includes schemas, taxonomies, and systematic methods. Worlds are cataloged. Variations are enumerated. Lenses are named.

But systematic does not mean rigid. These systems are used in a loose fashion—as long as they hit the spot, as long as they *work*. And "working" can only be judged by you, the listener, the reader. If the subway track makes you see the commute differently, it worked. If the tea ceremony track changes nothing, it didn't.

There is no authority here except recognition. Does it feel true? Then it's true enough.
