> *Experience spaces, not just stories.*

Hyperframes produces immersive audiobook experiences called **Rooms** — distinct narrative environments where philosophical ideas become sonic landscapes. Each Room is a self-contained world with its own atmosphere, rhythm, and vantage point.

**Aesthetics:** Blues Rock · Psychedelic Soul · Slowcore  
**Released:** December 2025

## Production

All Rooms are generated using a reproducible workflow:

1. **Narrative refactoring** — Classical texts transformed into speech-friendly prose
2. **Musical scoring** — Custom 2-3 minute introductions (ElevenLabs Music API)
3. **Speech synthesis** — High-quality, expressive narration (ElevenLabs Speech API)
4. **Audio merging** — Music, silence, and narration woven together
