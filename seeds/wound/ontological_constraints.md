## Temporal Wounds

Foreclosing the experience of time.

- **The Clock** — Time as external, divisible, linear resource. Stifles *duration* (Bergson).
- **The Weekend** — The segmentation of life into "production" and "recovery". Stifles *rhythm*.
- **The Deadline** — Time as vector toward completion. Stifles *unfolding*.
- **The Irreversibility** — "You can't go back." Stifles the *spiral*.
- **The Career** — Life as cumulative trajectory. Stifles *metamorphosis*.

## Spatial Wounds

Foreclosing the experience of space.

- **Euclidean Space** — Space as empty container. Stifles *intensive space* (feeling the room).
- **Private Property** — Space as owned/divided. Stifles *the commons*.
- **The Body-Boundary** — "I end at my skin." Stifles *environmental extension*.
- **The Nation-State** — Territory as political enclosure. Stifles *nomadism*.

## Ontological Wounds

Foreclosing the experience of being.

- **The Individual** — "I am a separate self." Stifles *the pack/assemblage*.
- **The Human** — "I am not an animal/machine/object." Stifles *brotherhood with things*.
- **The Gender** — "I must be this or that." Stifles *the spectrum*.
- **The Metrics** — "Value must be measurable." Stifles *the qualitative*.
- **The Language** — "If I can't say it, it's not real." Stifles *the ineffable*.

*Wounds are not to be healed. They are to be mapped. Knowing the wall allows you to find the door.*
