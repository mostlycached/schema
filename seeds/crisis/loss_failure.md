## Loss

The removal of a pillar.

### Relational Loss
- **Death of Parent** — Removal of the origin/shield. The realization of being "next".
- **Death of Child** — Reversal of temporal order. The future cancelled.
- **Death of Partner** — Cleaving of the "we". The empty side of the bed.
- **Divorce/Breakup** — rupture of the shared narrative. The rewriting of history.
- **Estrangement** — The living ghost. The presence of absence.

### Territorial Loss
- **Displacement/Eviction** — Loss of ground. Forced nomadism.
- **Exile** — Political or social expulsion. The ban.
- **Home Fire/Disaster** — Loss of the "shell". All objects gone at once.
- **Migration** — Leaving the familiar context. Linguistic loss.

### Ontological Loss
- **Loss of Faith** — ongoing collapse of the meaning-structure. The sky becomes empty.
- **Loss of Reputation** — Collapse of the social face. Being "cancelled" or shamed.
- **Loss of Ability** — The "I used to be able to...".
- **Loss of Memory** — The erosion of the self's continuity.

The blocked path. The wall.

### Moral/Personal Failure

*Loss hollows out a space. What enters that space is up to you.*
