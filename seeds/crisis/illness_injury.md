# Crisis Seeds: Illness & Injury

> The body's failure as an involuntary opening. The interruption of the "I can".

---

## Illness

The breakdown of the transparent body.

### Chronic Conditions
- **Chronic Fatigue / Long COVID** — The refusal of energy. Forces a confrontation with limits, gravity, and the non-linear nature of recovery. Cracks the "productivity" self.
- **Autoimmune Disorders** — The body attacking itself. Cracks the cohesive self. Introduces enemy-within dynamics.
- **Migraines** — The imposition of sensory overflow. Forces retreat, darkness, and the cessation of visual dominance.
- **Digestive Disorders** — The refusal of nourishment/integration. Forces a detailed negotiation with what is ingested.

### Acute Events
- **Fevers** — Thermal transformation. The delirium that loosens cognitive grip. Burn-through moments.
- **Infections** — Invasion by the other. The realization of porosity.
- **Surgery** — Controlled violation. The body as object-to-be-opened. The gap of anesthesia.

### Mental/Neurological
- **Depression** — The weight of gravity. The slowing of time. The removal of color/affect.
- **Anxiety/Panic** — The acceleration of time. The failure of the breathing mechanism. The catastrophic imagination.
- **Psychosis/Mania** — The rupture of consensus reality. The flooding of meaning.
- **Stroke/Aphasia** — The loss of language. The cut in the symbol-making machine.

## Injury

The specific breakage. The cut.

### Musculoskeletal
- **Back Injury** — The loss of the vertical axis. Forces a relationship with the ground.
- **Broken Bones** — The calcification of time during healing. The fragility of structure.
- **Joint Injuries (Knees, Shoulders)** — The loss of mobility/agency. The restriction of reach.

### Traumatic
- **Concussion** — The shaking of the seat of consciousness. Sensitivity to light/sound. The fog.
- **Burns** — The destruction of the boundary (skin). The pain that erases world.
- **Amputation/Loss of Function** — The permanent subtraction. The phantom limb (presence of absence).

## The Animisms of Crisis

What forces enter through the crack?

| Crisis | Animism |
|--------|---------|
| **Fatigue/Depression** | **Gravity** — The pull downward, the refusal to rise. |
| **Fever/Inflammation** | **Fire** — The consuming heat, the transformation. |
| **Dissociation/Psychosis** | **Sea** — The dissolution of boundaries, the flood. |
| **Panic/Vertigo** | **Height** — The groundlessness, the fall. |
| **Pain/Trauma** | **Knife** — The cut that separates "before" and "after". |
| **Blindness/Coma** | **Night** — The permanent surround of the unknown. |
