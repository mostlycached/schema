# Ideas / Concepts as Symbolic Seeds

> Purely conceptual seeds that can reconfigure worlds without material form.

## Framework Shifts

A different way of cutting up the world. Ontological renovations.

### From Individual to Relational
- **Systems thinking** — Parts cannot be understood without wholes
- **Process philosophy** — Things are stabilized processes, not substances
- **ANT (Actor-Network Theory)** — Agency distributed across networks
- **Enactivism** — Mind is relational, not internal
- **Ubuntu** — "I am because we are"

### From Static to Dynamic
- **Dialectics** — Contradiction as engine of change
- **Assemblage theory** — Compositions of heterogeneous elements
- **Phase transitions** — Qualitative change through quantitative accumulation
- **Morphogenesis** — How forms emerge from processes
- **Autopoiesis** — Self-organizing systems

### From Hierarchical to Immanent
- **Rhizome** — Non-hierarchical connection
- **Heterarchy** — Multiple simultaneous orderings
- **Flat ontology** — No level is more real than another
- **Immanence** — No outside, no transcendence

### From Representational to Performative
- **Speech act theory** — Words do things
- **Practice theory** — Meaning through doing
- **Embodied cognition** — Thinking is bodied
- **Performativity** — Identity made through repetition

### From Substance to Event
- **Whitehead's occasions** — Reality as drops of experience
- **Badiou's event** — The rupture that creates new truths
- **Bergson's duration** — Time as lived, not measured
- **Simondon's individuation** — Being as becoming

### Undecidables
- **Gödel's incompleteness** — Systems cannot prove their own consistency
- **Halting problem** — Computation's limits
- **The continuum hypothesis** — Size of infinity undecidable
- **Quantum measurement** — Observation changes observed

### Category Breakers
- **The pharmakon** — Poison and cure
- **The sublime** — Too much to comprehend
- **The uncanny** — Familiar made strange

## Meta-Concepts for Conceptual Work

Tools for thinking about thinking.

### Modes of Reasoning
- **Abduction** — Inference to best explanation
- **Dialectic** — Thinking through opposition
- **Phenomenological reduction** — Bracketing assumptions
- **Genealogy** — Tracing contingent origins
- **Deconstruction** — Finding internal contradictions

### Conceptual Operations
- **Inversion** — Flip the hierarchy
- **Extension** — Push to extreme
- **Combination** — Hybrid two frames
- **Subtraction** — Remove a term
- **Substitution** — Replace key term

### Levels of Abstraction
- **Concrete** — This specific instance
- **Type** — This kind of thing
- **Category** — This family of kinds
- **Schema** — Structure common to categories
- **Formal** — Pure relational structure
