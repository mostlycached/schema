# Return Seeds

> The second call. Going back to what was abandoned to find what was left there.

---

## Returning to Practice

"I used to do this."

- **The Childhood Instrument** — Piano, violin, guitar. Fingers remembering old patterns.
- **Drawing/Visual Art** — Recovering the "eye" before critique shut it down.
- **Sport/Movement** — The body remembering how to move vs. how to "exercise".
- **Language** — Re-learning a tongue once known or half-known.

## Returning to Place

"I know this ground."

- **The Hometown** — Going back not to stay, but to see. The uncanny familiar.
- **The Ancestral Land** — Visiting where they came from. Genealogy as geography.
- **The Site of Trauma** — Returning to the scene to rewrite the ending.
- **The Previous City** — Walking old streets with new eyes.

## Returning to People

"The unfinished conversation."

- **The Ex** — Not to reunite, but to witness who you were then.
- **The Estranged Parent** — The second attempt, from adulthood.
- **The Old Friend** — Bridging the gap of years.
- **The Ghost** — Visiting the grave. Talking to the dead.

## Returning to Texts/Works

"It reads differently now."

- **Rereading Formative Books** — Seeing the marginalia of your younger self.
- **Rewatching Films** — Seeing the background, not just the plot.
- **Finishing the Unfinished** — Completing the project abandoned years ago.

*The return is never a circle. It is a spiral. You come back to the same coordinates at a different altitude.*
