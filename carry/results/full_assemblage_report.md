# Assemblage Network: Alex

## Network Overview

**Subject**: Alex
**Total Assemblages**: 3

### Shared Components
- **Hands**: Professional-Software-Engineer, Creative-Writer
- **Eyes**: Professional-Software-Engineer, Creative-Writer, Weekend-Runner

### Shared Territories
- **Coffee Shop**: Professional-Software-Engineer, Creative-Writer

### Intensity Conflicts
**speed**:
  - Professional-Software-Engineer: 0.80
  - Creative-Writer: 0.30
  - Weekend-Runner: 0.60


### Transversal Lines of Flight (Conflict)
*Lines of flight from conflicts BETWEEN assemblages*

**→ Forced slowdown or injury (Hands)**
- Source: inter-assemblage conflict
- Hands operates at incompatible speeds: Professional-Software-Engineer (0.8) vs Creative-Writer (0.3). Body can't sustain switching.
- Trigger: Repetitive strain, pain, or exhaustion forces resolution

**→ Forced slowdown or injury (Eyes)**
- Source: inter-assemblage conflict
- Eyes operates at incompatible speeds: Professional-Software-Engineer (0.8) vs Creative-Writer (0.3). Body can't sustain switching.
- Trigger: Repetitive strain, pain, or exhaustion forces resolution

**→ Hybrid practice at 0.6 speed**
- Source: inter-assemblage conflict
- Speed varies wildly across assemblages: Professional-Software-Engineer (0.8), Creative-Writer (0.3), Weekend-Runner (0.6). Forces creation of intermediate practice.
- Trigger: Burnout from switching or discovery of middle way


### Synergistic Lines of Flight (Opportunity)
*Lines of flight from COMPOSITION of assemblages - new capacities*

**→ Technical Writing / Documentation**
- Source: assemblage composition
- Intersection of Professional-Software-Engineer (technical expertise) and Creative-Writer (writing skills). New capacity emerges that neither has alone.
- Trigger: Blog post request, documentation need, or teaching opportunity

**→ Creative Coding / Computational Art**
- Source: assemblage composition
- Programming skills from Professional-Software-Engineer + aesthetic sense from Creative-Writer = generative art, interactive narratives.
- Trigger: Encounter with p5.js, Processing, or creative coding community

**→ Performance Science / Body Optimization**
- Source: assemblage composition
- Optimization mindset from Professional-Software-Engineer + body knowledge from Weekend-Runner = data-driven training, biohacking.
- Trigger: Wearable tech access, training plateau, or quantified self discovery

**→ Embodied Storytelling / Movement Poetry**
- Source: assemblage composition
- Narrative capacity from Creative-Writer + movement knowledge from Weekend-Runner = somatic writing, running memoirs.
- Trigger: Writing retreat, trail narrative project, or performance invitation
