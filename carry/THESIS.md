A human walks with a set of pocket carry items. Their biological assemblage, and their technical assemblage.

When a foreign object is introduced, it forces a gravitational response through its persistence, affecting the human's ontological internal and inter-external relations.

Ontology, physical objects, symbolic objects, mathematical methods, all seen as carry objects, seeping deep into the psyche and remodifying them - like a cane modifying a blind man's intra and inter relations.

In this project, we explore the consequences of this injection to the lifeworld of a human being. Setup simulations similar to conatus/simulation/lifeworld.py and setup an index of carry objects and explore immediate and long term consequences of their introduction to the lifeworld.
