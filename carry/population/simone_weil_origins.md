## KEY DEVELOPMENTAL PATTERNS

### 1. Seed → Transformation → Destruction
- Justice-at-5 → Factory-at-25 → Death-at-34
- Childhood impulse becomes embodied practice becomes fatal trajectory

### 2. Injection + Tension → Crisis
- Alain (attention) + Christ (encounter) = Mystical attention practice
- But Greek (pagan beauty) + Christ = cannot accept Church (Jews, violence)

### 3. Molar Refusal → Molecular Escape
- "Jewish identity" (molar) refused → but cannot escape body/history
- "Church membership" (molar) refused → but lives Catholic spirituality molecularly

### 4. Deliberate Assemblage Creation
- Factory work was CHOSEN to create new assemblage
- Not spontaneous - intentional embodiment
- This is rare: most assemblages emerge, she engineered hers

## WHAT NEVER DEVELOPED (Virtual Unrealized)

| Potential | Why Blocked |
|-----------|-------------|
| Academic career | Chose factory, activism, exile |
| Marriage/children | Never pursued, body rejected? |
| Jewish religious identity | Family secular, later actively refused |
| Church membership | Threshold-dwelling by choice |
| Long life | Self-destruction as solidarity |
