# Paul Erdős: Mathematics Obsessive, 1970

*Almost no life outside mathematics. Radical focus, minimal personal assemblages.*

## MATHEMATICAL (35) - TOTAL DOMINANCE

7. **Graph-Theory-Pioneer** - Ramsey theory
8. **Probability-Contributor** - random graphs
9. **Combinatorics-Master** - counting arguments
10. **Elementary-Methods-Preferrer** - no heavy machinery
11. **Beauty-in-Proofs-Seeker** - "The Book" of God
12. **Problem-Session-Host** - all hours
13. **Blackboard-User** - chalk, diagrams
14. **Napkin-Calculator** - any surface works
15. **Journal-Submitter** - constant output
16. **Referee-Report-Writer** - community service

18. **Student-Question-Asker** - testing, teaching
19. **Lecture-Giver** - universities worldwide
20. **Conference-Attender** - all of them
21. **Math-Gossip-Sharer** - who proved what
22. **Attribution-Careful** - credit where due
23. **Speed-Calculator** - mental arithmetic
24. **Pattern-Recognizer** - see what others miss
25. **Generalization-Seeker** - extend every result
26. **Counter-Example-Finder** - break conjectures
27. **Open-Problem-Collector** - lists, bounties
28. **Prize-Offerer** - $10-$1000 for solutions
29. **Epsilon-Namer** - children = "epsilons"
30. **Supreme-Fascist-Invoker** - God hides proofs
31. **The-Book-Believer** - perfect proofs exist
32. **Coffee-to-Theorem-Converter** - "a mathematician is a machine..."
33. **Night-Worker** - 19-hour days
34. **Amphetamine-User** - focus, productivity
35. **Sleep-Minimizer** - 4 hours if that

## ITINERANT (12)

36. **Suitcase-Liver** - two bags total possessions
37. **Couch-Surfer** - colleagues' homes
38. **Airport-Transiter** - constant flights
39. **No-Fixed-Address** - truly homeless by choice
40. **Visa-Collector** - many countries
41. **Banned-from-US** - McCarthy era, returned later
42. **Hungary-Base** - mother's apartment when alive
43. **Guest-Room-Occupant** - showing up "my brain is open"
44. **Lecture-Fee-Liver** - small honoraria
45. **Prize-Money-Giver** - donated away
46. **Laundry-Dependent** - hosts do it
47. **Meal-Receiver** - hosts provide

## NEARLY ABSENT DOMAINS

### Social (5 only)
48. **Mother-Devoted** - lived with until her death
49. **Mother-Death-Devastated** - 1971, never recovered fully
50. **Colleague-Friendship** - but mathematical basis
51. **Small-Talk-Unable** - only math talk
52. **Party-Avoider** - unless mathematicians

### Physical/Bodily (4 only)
53. **Caffeine-Dependent** - coffee, constant
54. **Stimulant-Dependent** - amphetamines, decades
55. **Body-Neglector** - minimal exercise
56. **Nutrition-Careless** - ate what given

### Material (3 only)
57. **Money-Careless** - gave it away
58. **Possession-Free** - deliberately
59. **Will-Less** - no estate, nothing to give

### Domestic (0)
*None. No home, no household.*

---

**Pattern**: 47/59 assemblages are MATHEMATICS or TRAVEL-FOR-MATHEMATICS

**Key Insight**: Erdős is almost a pure mathematical assemblage. The personal, domestic, material domains are nearly empty. Not "work-life balance" but "only work, no life."

**Defining Statement**: "Property is a nuisance."

**Tensions**:
- Mathematical-Brilliance vs Social-Incapacity = trade-off
- Generosity (prize money) vs Dependence (hosts) = asymmetric reciprocity
- Amphetamine-Use vs Longevity (83 years) = surprising
- Mother-Devoted vs World-Itinerant = after her death, lost anchor
