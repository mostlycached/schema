## I. PHYSICAL CARRY

Objects worn, pocketed, or constantly present.

### Prosthetic Extensions

| Object | Animism | Intra-Modification | Inter-Modification |
|--------|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Cane (blind person)** | Earth, Night | Transforms vision into haptic-spatial sensing; extends body boundary to cane tip | Social marker; others navigate differently around you |
| **Wheelchair** | Earth, Gravity | Seated relation to space; arms become locomotion | Eye-level politics; architecture becomes barrier/gateway |

### Tools-as-Organs

| Object | Animism | Intra-Modification | Inter-Modification |
|--------|---------|--------------------|--------------------|

### Instruments

| Object | Animism | Intra-Modification | Inter-Modification |
|--------|---------|--------------------|--------------------|

### Status Objects

| Object | Animism | Intra-Modification | Inter-Modification |

Concepts, methods, and formal structures that restructure cognition.

### First Formal Encounters

| Object | Animism | Intra-Modification | Inter-Modification |
|--------|---------|--------------------|--------------------|

## IV. ONTOLOGICAL CARRY

Concepts that restructure the very categories of experience.

### Philosophical Encounters

| **Meditation cushion** | Sitting | Night, Earth | Space marked; posture cued |
| **Running shoes** | Running | Earth | Body activated; excuse removed |

## Injection Dynamics Summary

Every carry object injection follows this arc:

1. **Disruption**: Object's persistence creates friction with existing Stances
2. **Reconfiguration**: Novelty search finds new Stance-Component bindings  
3. **Sedimentation**: New configuration becomes habitual, invisible

The deeper the carry (ontological > mathematical > symbolic > physical), the more complete the sedimentation — and the harder to remove.
