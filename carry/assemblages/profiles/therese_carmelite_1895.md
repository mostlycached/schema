## ABSENT DOMAINS

*No economic assemblages (vow of poverty)*
*No social assemblages outside convent*
*No domestic assemblages (common life)*
*No travel (enclosure)*
*No recreation beyond community*

---

**Pattern**: 42/60 assemblages are PRAYER/COMMUNITY/SPIRITUAL

**Key Insight**: Enclosure literally removes most domains. What remains is DENSE - prayer is not one practice but 22 distinct assemblages. Community life is not one thing but 12 differentiated practices.

**The "Little Way"**: Dense assemblages in small acts - each tiny sacrifice, each moment of patience, each hidden smile is its own practice.

**Tensions**:
- Spiritual-Darkness vs Continued-Practice = faith as will not feeling
- Obedience vs Own-Insights = tension with superiors
- Suffering-Hidden vs Autobiography = revelation only after death
- Doubt-Intense vs Doctor-of-Church (posthumous) = irony
