## KEY DEVELOPMENTAL PATTERNS

### 1. Institutional Funnel
- JEE culture → Engineering college → Campus placement → IT job
- This is STRUCTURAL, not individual choice
- Assemblages are mass-produced by education system

### 2. Migration as Assemblage Explosion
- Chennai → Bangalore created 15+ new assemblages
- Urban migration multiplies domains (transit, financial, social)

### 3. COVID as Phase Transition
- Destroyed office assemblages, created WFH assemblages
- Permanent hybrid = two incomplete clusters

### 4. Dormant vs Active
- Carnatic music: PRESENT but dormant (could reactivate)
- Tamil home language: Still active (code-switching)
- Joint family tolerance: Transferred to flatmate/office

### 5. Tension: Traditional vs Modern
- Marriage-Pressure (external, parents) vs Bumble-Dater (internal, chosen)
- This is THE defining tension of her generation

## VIRTUAL UNREALIZED

| Potential | Why Blocked |
|-----------|-------------|
| IIT identity | Didn't clear JEE, or didn't try |
| MS abroad | Cost, family, timing |
| Startup founder | Risk aversion, stability need |
| Carnatic performer | Dropped, could return |
| Marriage (arranged) | Resisting, delaying |
| Therapy | Considering, stigma |
