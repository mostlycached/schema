# Optimization: The Imperial Eunuch

**World**: The Imperial Eunuch (#89)
**Type**: Long-lasting (Genealogy: Ancient Near East -> Chinese Imperial Court -> Abolition 1912)

## 1. Value Systems Selection (from VALUES.md)

To optimize this world, we focus on:

*   **Systemic Functionality (Systemic)**: The Eunuch as the ultimate "System Administrator." By removing biological imperatives (lineage, sexual desire), the Eunuch becomes a pure node in the imperial network.
*   **Psychoanalytic (Values)**: The concept of **Castration** not as a loss, but as a liberation from the Phallus. The "Phantom Limb" of masculinity becomes a source of psychic energy redirected toward political power.
*   **Aesthetic of the Artificial (Aesthetic)**: The Eunuch is a "Constructed Being." Like a bonsai tree, he is shaped by violence to achieve a specific form of perfection.

## 2. Intervention Techniques (from INTERVENTION_TECHNIQUES.md)

We apply these techniques to shift the world and reveal its core:

*   **Somatic Intervention**:
    *   *The Cut*: The foundational trauma that defines the ontology. It creates a "Void" at the center of the self, which is filled with the Emperor's will.
    *   *The Voice*: The high-pitched, unbroken voice as a sonic marker of difference.

*   **Metaphor**:
    *   *The Gatekeeper*: The Eunuch controls the "Binary Code" of Inside/Outside (The Forbidden City). He is the membrane between the Sacred (Emperor) and the Profane (World).
    *   *The Shadow*: He is the Emperor's shadow—always present, but socially invisible.

*   **Structural Shift**:
    *   *From Biological Family to State Family*: The Eunuch cannot have children, so the State becomes his child. His legacy is the dynasty, not his DNA.

## 3. Registers

### Formal Register
The Imperial Eunuch represents a radical "biological hack" of the feudal administrative apparatus. By surgically excising the reproductive imperative, the system eliminates the conflict of interest between "Family" and "State." The Eunuch is an "Administrative Cyborg," a human optimized for pure loyalty and bureaucratic function. The "Castration" serves as a "hard-coded" loyalty patch, ensuring that the agent's accumulation of capital (Influence) cannot be transferred to biological heirs, thus preventing the rise of rival dynasties.

### Poetic Register
He is the man who is not a man, the ghost who walks in the daylight. He gave up his future—the sons he would never have—to hold the present in his hands. He pays attention to the whispers behind the silk screens, the rustle of a robe, the temperature of the Emperor's tea. He is the hollow reed through which the wind of power blows. He has no root in the earth, so he climbs the sky. His power is the power of the void: because he wants nothing for himself, he can take everything for the Emperor.
