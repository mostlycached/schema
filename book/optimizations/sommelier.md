# Optimization: The Sommelier

**World**: The Sommelier (#102)
**Type**: Long-lasting (Genealogy: French Court -> Modern Restaurant)

## 1. Value Systems Selection (from VALUES.md)

To optimize this world, we focus on:

*   **Phenomenological (Values)**: Taste/Smell. The hyper-development of the chemical senses. The ability to deconstruct a liquid into its constituent memories (blackberry, slate, cat pee).
*   **Epistemic (Values)**: Taxonomy. The encyclopedic knowledge of geography, geology, and vintage. The wine list as a map of the world.
*   **Aesthetic of the Artificial (Aesthetic)**: The Service. The ritual of the pour. The decanting. The theatre of the table.

## 2. Intervention Techniques (from INTERVENTION_TECHNIQUES.md)

We apply these techniques to shift the world and reveal its core:

*   **Metaphor**:
    *   *The Time Machine*: Wine is bottled time. To drink a 1982 Bordeaux is to drink the sunlight and the rain of 1982.
    *   *The Translator*: The Sommelier translates the cryptic language of the label into the emotional language of the guest.

*   **Somatic Intervention**:
    *   *The Spit*: The professional necessity. You cannot get drunk. You must taste and release.
    *   *The Blind Tasting*: The ultimate test. Stripping away the bias of the label to find the truth of the juice.

## 3. Registers

### Formal Register
The Sommelier represents the "Curation of Fermented Agricultural Capital." He is the "Gatekeeper of the Cellar." His function is "Gustatory Matching"—pairing the chemical profile of the wine (acid, tannin, sugar) with the chemical profile of the food. The tension lies in the "Subjectivity of Taste" vs. the "Objectivity of Price." The optimization is the elevation of the Sommelier from a "Waiter" to a "Sensory Guide," a shaman who navigates the liquid landscape.

### Poetic Register
He holds the glass by the stem. He tilts it against the white tablecloth. He pays attention to the "Legs"—the viscosity. He swirls. He inhales. He is not smelling grapes; he is smelling a hillside in Burgundy. He is smelling the limestone, the fog, the sweat of the monk who planted the vine in the 12th century. He pays attention to the **Story**. Every bottle is a novel written by the earth. He is the librarian who knows where the best stories are hidden.
