# The Tuareg Caravan (Room-Frame Experiment)

The inhabitant of this room is a mollusk of the wind. In the Tuareg caravan, the architecture is the body. The *Tagelmust* wraps ten times around the skull, creating a portable room. To live here is to carry your walls with you.

The "Outside" ceases to be a place and becomes a hostile element. The Glare is a solvent that wants to dissolve the human form. This room of indigo creates a Zone of Opacity in a landscape of absolute transparency. Inside the layers of cotton, the moisture of the breath recycling into a private humid micro-climate. The Tuareg walks *inside* his clothes, looking out through a slit that serves as the only window in a house of fabric.

Because the house travels, "Address" is replaced by "Trajectory." The room is defined by the line it draws across the dunes. The salt they carry serves as the ballast that keeps the shell grounded. Without this weight, the wind might blow the indigo men into the sky like loose petals.

Yet the shell is under siege. The satellite eye (GPS) has made the desert transparent. The truck (Hilux) has made the trajectory linear. The Tuareg is a creature of the curve forced to live in a grid. He tightens the veil. He retreats deeper into the blue folds. As long as the shell holds, he remains a sovereign nation of one, moving through a world that can map his location but never touch his skin.
