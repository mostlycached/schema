# Optimization: The Executioner

**World**: The Executioner (#100)
**Type**: Long-lasting (Genealogy: Royal Justice -> State Penitentiary)

## 1. Value Systems Selection (from VALUES.md)

To optimize this world, we focus on:

*   **Ethical (Values)**: Justice/Violence. The paradox that the state must kill to prevent killing. The Executioner takes the sin of the murder onto himself so the society can remain clean.
*   **Somatic Intervention (Values)**: The Strike. The skill required to sever a head with a single blow. It is a martial art of mercy (a clean death).
*   **Phenomenological (Values)**: The Pariah. The social exclusion. No one will touch the Executioner. He lives on the edge of town.

## 2. Intervention Techniques (from INTERVENTION_TECHNIQUES.md)

We apply these techniques to shift the world and reveal its core:

*   **Metaphor**:
    *   *The Hood*: Not to hide the face from the victim, but to hide the face from the crowd. To depersonalize the act. He is not a man; he is the Law.
    *   *The Sword/Axe*: The instrument of separation. It divides the body (nature) from the head (reason).

*   **Dialectics**:
    *   *Clean/Dirty*: The Executioner is "unclean" (taboo), yet he performs the "cleansing" of the social body.

## 3. Registers

### Formal Register
The Executioner represents the "Monopoly on Violence" embodied in a single agent. He is the "Terminal Valve" of the judicial system. His function is to transmute the abstract sentence of the judge into the concrete reality of death. The tension lies in the "Professionalization of Death." The shift from the gruesome spectacle of the scaffold (torture, drawing and quartering) to the clinical efficiency of the guillotine and the lethal injection. The optimization is the understanding of the Executioner as the "Sin-Eater" of the state.

### Poetic Register
He stands on the scaffold, leaning on the axe. He pays attention to the neck. He does not see a person; he sees a vertebrae, a muscle, a target. He prays for a clean cut. Not for himself, but for the man kneeling in the straw. He pays attention to the silence of the crowd. He is the loneliest man in the world. He is the hand that cuts the thread. He goes home to his wife and children, and he washes his hands, but the red never really comes out.
