# Optimization: The Whaling Ship

**World**: The Whaling Ship (#97)
**Type**: Long-lasting (Genealogy: Basque Whaling -> Nantucket Boom -> International Ban)

## 1. Value Systems Selection (from VALUES.md)

To optimize this world, we focus on:

*   **Economical (Values)**: Extraction. The Whale as a swimming oil well. The transformation of nature into capital (light, lubrication, corset stays).
*   **Phenomenological (Values)**: The Sublime. The encounter with the "Leviathan," a creature so large it defies comprehension.
*   **Ethical (Values)**: The shift from "Heroic Conquest" to "Ecological Crime."

## 2. Intervention Techniques (from INTERVENTION_TECHNIQUES.md)

We apply these techniques to shift the world and reveal its core:

*   **Metaphor**:
    *   *The White Whale*: The obsession. The goal that eats the pursuer. Moby Dick as the ultimate optimization of the hunting drive.
    *   *The Try-Works*: The factory on the deck. Boiling the blubber at sea. Hellfire in the middle of the ocean.

*   **Somatic Intervention**:
    *   *The Nantucket Sleighride*: The physical experience of being towed by a harpooned whale in a small boat. The adrenaline of the connection.

*   **Dialectics**:
    *   *Man/God*: The whale is a god-monster. To kill it is an act of hubris.

## 3. Registers

### Formal Register
The Whaling Ship represents the "Industrialization of the Ocean." It is a "Mobile Slaughterhouse" designed to process biomass into commodities (spermaceti, baleen, ambergris). The system relies on the "Global Logistics of Pursuit"—ships gone for three, four years, chasing migration patterns. The tension lies in the "Resource Exhaustion" and the "Moral Awakening" of the 20th century. The whale shifted from "Resource" to "Sentient Being." The optimization is the understanding of the Whaler not just as a butcher, but as the "First Globalist," mapping the unknown corners of the world in pursuit of light.

### Poetic Register
He stands in the crosstrees, scanning the horizon. "There she blows!" The cry drops down to the deck like a hammer. He pays attention to the spout—the vapor of a lung the size of a car. He is hunting the Leviathan. He is hunting the source of the light that burns in the lamps of London and New York. He is a man of blood and grease, living on a wooden chip in a universe of water. He knows that the whale is not just a fish; it is a mountain that breathes.
