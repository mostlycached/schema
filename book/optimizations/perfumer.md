# Optimization: The Perfumer

**World**: The Perfumer (#103)
**Type**: Long-lasting (Genealogy: Ancient Egypt -> Grasse -> Synthetic Chemistry)

## 1. Value Systems Selection (from VALUES.md)

To optimize this world, we focus on:

*   **Phenomenological (Values)**: Olfaction. The sense most directly linked to the limbic system (memory/emotion). The Perfumer paints with invisible colors.
*   **Aesthetic of the Artificial (Aesthetic)**: The Synthetic. The realization that "Natural" is not always better. Aldehydes (Chanel No. 5) created a scent that does not exist in nature.
*   **Economical (Values)**: The Brand. Perfume is the highest margin product in the luxury world. Selling water and alcohol for the price of gold.

## 2. Intervention Techniques (from INTERVENTION_TECHNIQUES.md)

We apply these techniques to shift the world and reveal its core:

*   **Metaphor**:
    *   *The Organ*: The Perfumer's desk, arranged with hundreds of vials like the keys of a musical instrument. He composes "Notes" and "Chords."
    *   *The Ghost*: The scent is a ghost of a flower. It is presence in absence.

*   **Somatic Intervention**:
    *   *The Nose*: The "Nez." A professional athlete of smell. Insured for millions.

*   **Dialectics**:
    *   *Top/Base*: The volatility of the scent. The Top notes fly away; the Base notes stay. The perfume is a temporal sculpture.

## 3. Registers

### Formal Register
The Perfumer represents the "Molecular Architecture of Desire." He manipulates volatile organic compounds to trigger specific emotional responses. The system relies on the "Pyramid Structure" (Top, Heart, Base notes) to create a temporal experience of the scent. The tension lies in the "IFRA Regulations" (banning allergens like Oakmoss) and the "Mass Market Homogenization" (everything smells like vanilla and fruit). The optimization is the "Niche Perfumery"—the return to the weird, the animalic, the challenging.

### Poetic Register
He sits at the organ, surrounded by amber glass. He dips the blotter strip (*mouillette*) into the vial. He waves it under his nose. He pays attention to the **Silence**. He is listening for a smell. He mixes the Rose de Mai with the Civet (the anal gland of a cat). Beauty and the Beast. He is trying to bottle a memory. He is trying to make a liquid that smells like the back of a lover's neck, or the rain on hot asphalt, or the feeling of being safe.
