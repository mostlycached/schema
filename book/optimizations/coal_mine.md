# Optimization: The Coal Mine

**World**: The Coal Mine (#96)
**Type**: Long-lasting (Genealogy: Industrial Revolution -> Green Energy Transition)

## 1. Value Systems Selection (from VALUES.md)

To optimize this world, we focus on:

*   **Economical (Values)**: Energy. The Miner is the engine of the Industrial Revolution. He digs up the stored sunlight of the Carboniferous period.
*   **Somatic Intervention (Values)**: The Black Lung (*Pneumoconiosis*). The mine enters the body. The lungs turn to stone.
*   **Ethical (Values)**: Solidarity. The brotherhood of the deep. You trust your life to the man next to you.

## 2. Intervention Techniques (from INTERVENTION_TECHNIQUES.md)

We apply these techniques to shift the world and reveal its core:

*   **Metaphor**:
    *   *The Canary*: The biological sensor. The sacrifice that warns the system.
    *   *The Lift*: The descent into the underworld. The daily funeral.

*   **Dialectics**:
    *   *Light/Dark*: The absolute darkness of the seam vs. the beam of the headlamp.
    *   *Surface/Deep*: The split between the world of the living and the world of work.

*   **Somatic Intervention**:
    *   *The Cramped Space*: The body forced to work in seams only 30 inches high. The evolution of the "Miner's Crouch."

## 3. Registers

### Formal Register
The Coal Mine represents the "Extraction of Fossilized Solar Capital." The Miner is a "Bio-Mechanical Actuator" operating in a hostile, subterranean environment. The system relies on the "Commodifiction of Risk"—the miner trades his health (lungs, joints) for wages. The tension lies in the "Ecological Obsolescence" of the industry. Coal is the "Dirty Fuel" that built the modern world but now threatens to destroy it (Climate Change). The optimization is the recognition of the Miner not as a villain of pollution, but as the "Titan" who held up the sky of modernity on his back.

### Poetic Register
He steps into the cage. The bell rings. The floor drops out. He pays attention to the pressure in his ears as he falls a thousand feet into the earth. He is going back in time, to the swamps of three hundred million years ago. He pays attention to the **Seam**. It is a black vein in the rock, shiny and brittle. He hacks at it. He breathes the dust. He is the man who burns so that the world can have light. He is the shadow in the furnace.
