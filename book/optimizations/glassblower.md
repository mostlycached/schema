# Optimization: The Glassblower

**World**: The Glassblower (#105)
**Type**: Long-lasting (Genealogy: Roman Glass -> Murano -> Studio Glass)

## 1. Value Systems Selection (from VALUES.md)

To optimize this world, we focus on:

*   **Somatic Intervention (Values)**: The Breath. The Gaffer inflates the molten glass with his own lungs. The object is a crystallized breath.
*   **Phenomenological (Values)**: Heat. The studio is a volcano. The Gaffer works at the limit of human heat tolerance.
*   **Aesthetic of the Artificial (Aesthetic)**: Transparency. Glass is a solid that looks like a liquid. It is the material of light.

## 2. Intervention Techniques (from INTERVENTION_TECHNIQUES.md)

We apply these techniques to shift the world and reveal its core:

*   **Metaphor**:
    *   *The Womb*: The furnace (*The Glory Hole*) is the womb where the object is born.
    *   *The Dance*: The constant rotation. If you stop turning the pipe, the glass droops. Gravity is the enemy.

*   **Dialectics**:
    *   *Solid/Liquid*: Glass is an amorphous solid. It is always moving, just very slowly.
    *   *Fragile/Strong*: Glass can hold a building up, but it shatters with a tap.

## 3. Registers

### Formal Register
The Glassblower represents the "Thermal Manipulation of Amorphous Solids." He works with a material that transitions from liquid to solid without crystallizing. The system relies on the "Centrifugal Force" and "Gravity" to shape the object while it is in the plastic state. The tension lies in the "Industrialization" (float glass, bottles) vs. the "Artisanal Survival" (Studio Glass). The optimization is the understanding of the Glassblower as a "Choreographer of Light," trapping photons in a silica cage.

### Poetic Register
He dips the pipe into the crucible. He gathers a ball of fire. He pays attention to the **Color**. Orange means soft. Red means stiff. Black means dead. He blows into the pipe. His cheeks puff out. He is giving his ghost to the machine. The bubble expands. He rolls it on the marver. He swings it. He is dancing with a partner that is 2,000 degrees hot and wants to burn him. He freezes the fire into ice.
