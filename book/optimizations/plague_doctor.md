# Optimization: The Plague Doctor

**World**: The Plague Doctor (#98)
**Type**: Long-lasting (Genealogy: Black Death -> 17th Century PPE -> Modern Epidemiology)

## 1. Value Systems Selection (from VALUES.md)

To optimize this world, we focus on:

*   **Somatic Intervention (Values)**: The Mask. The Beak filled with herbs (theriac) to filter the "Miasma." The waxed leather coat to repel fluids. It is the first Hazmat suit.
*   **Epistemic (Values)**: The shift from "Miasma Theory" (bad air) to "Germ Theory" (microbes). The Doctor is operating on a false theory but achieving a functional result (isolation).
*   **Aesthetic of the Artificial (Aesthetic)**: The Defamiliarization. The Doctor looks like a bird of death. The aesthetic creates a "Placebo Effect" of authority and terror.

## 2. Intervention Techniques (from INTERVENTION_TECHNIQUES.md)

We apply these techniques to shift the world and reveal its core:

*   **Metaphor**:
    *   *The Bird*: The beak makes the human inhuman. It signals that the Doctor is exempt from the laws of the plague. He is a scavenger/predator.
    *   *The Stick*: The cane used to examine patients without touching them. The "Social Distancing" tool.

*   **Dialectics**:
    *   *Cure/Poison*: The Doctor brings hope, but he also brings the confirmation of death. To see him is to know you are doomed.

## 3. Registers

### Formal Register
The Plague Doctor represents the "Bureaucratization of Mortality." Hired by the city-state during epidemics, his function is not primarily to cure (which is impossible) but to "Record and Quarantine." He is a "Census Taker of the Dead." The "Beak Mask" is a primitive "Respirator," utilizing aromatic compounds to counteract the perceived pathogenic "Miasma." The tension lies in the "Performative Efficacy" of the role—he looks powerful, but he is largely impotent against the bacillus *Yersinia pestis*. The optimization is the transformation of the Doctor into the "Epidemiologist," the one who tracks the vector rather than saving the individual.

### Poetic Register
He walks through the silent streets of Venice, tapping his cane on the cobblestones. *Tap. Tap. Tap.* He pays attention to the smell—the sweet, rotting scent of the buboes. He breathes through a beak filled with dried roses, camphor, and myrrh. He is a bird who cannot fly. He is the witness to the end of the world. He does not touch the dying; he points at them with his stick, marking them for the grave. He is the wall between the healthy and the sick.
