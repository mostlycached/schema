# Optimization: The Jain Ascetic

**World**: The Jain Ascetic (#87)
**Type**: Long-lasting (Genealogy: Mahavira -> Shramana -> Modernity)

## 1. Value Systems Selection (from VALUES.md)

To optimize this world, we focus on:

*   **Epistemic Humility (Epistemic)**: The doctrine of *Anekantavada* (many-sidedness). Reality is too complex for a single viewpoint. This is the ultimate antidote to the "Attention Economy" of hot takes and certainty.
*   **Micro-Ethics (Ethical)**: *Ahimsa* (non-violence) applied to the microscopic level. Paying attention to the invisible (microbes, insects).
*   **Somatic Purity (Phenomenological)**: The body as a filter. The mask (*muhapatti*) and the broom (*rajoharan*) are technologies of care.

## 2. Intervention Techniques (from INTERVENTION_TECHNIQUES.md)

We apply these techniques to shift the world and reveal its core:

*   **Somatic Intervention**:
    *   *The Muhapatti (Mouth Shield)*: A filter for speech and breath. It prevents the killing of air-beings, but also filters the violence of language.
    *   *The Rajoharan (Broom)*: Sweeping the path not to clean it, but to save the invisible. A reversal of "cleaning" (which usually means killing germs).

*   **Scale Shift (Micro/Macro)**:
    *   *The Microscopic Gaze*: The Jain pays attention to a scale of life that modern science only discovered with the microscope. They were the first microbiologists of the soul.
    *   *The Infinite Time*: *Karma* as a physical substance that weighs down the soul.

*   **Metaphor**:
    *   *The Body as a sieve*: Filtering karma.
    *   *The Diet as an Algorithm*: A strict code of what enters the system to prevent "bugs" (violence).

## 3. Registers

### Formal Register
The Jain Ascetic operates a high-fidelity ethical sensorium designed to minimize entropic violence (*himsa*) within a closed thermodynamic system. The *muhapatti* and *rajoharan* function as "ethical prosthetic devices," extending the agent's awareness into the microscopic domain. The system optimizes for **Epistemic Humility** through the protocol of *Anekantavada*, rejecting binary truth-claims in favor of a multi-modal logic that mirrors quantum superposition.

### Poetic Register
He walks without footprints, or rather, he erases them as he goes. His broom is a whisper against the earth, asking forgiveness from the dust. He breathes through a white shield, terrified that his very existence is a hurricane to the invisible nations of the air. He is a man trying to be lighter than light, to exist without displacing a single atom of another's joy. He pays attention to the silence between heartbeats, where the karma accumulates like soot.
