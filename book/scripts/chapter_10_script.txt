The Ancient Scribe

This room is an Archive. The Scribe (Homo scriptor) acts as a biological mechanism for the transmutation of time into matter.

I. The Room of Mud (c. 3000 BCE)
The first Scribe sat by the river with a reed stylus (Arundo donax) and a wet tablet. The act was geological. He pushed the shadow of a thought into the mud. The taxonomy of the world was limited to what could be hardened by the sun. The "cuneiform" wedge became the first pixel of history.

II. The Room of Ink
The reed became the quill... the clay became papyrus. "Liquid memory" allowed for a faster velocity of thought... but a decrease in durability. The Library of Alexandria burned because ink is flammable. The Scribe moved to the Monastery... becoming a copying engine... reproducing the Gospels by candlelight. Fidelity was the only law... a single error in copying the Word of God was a sin that could alter the universe.

III. The Room of Light
The current iteration sits in a cubicle lit by blue light. The clay has sublimated into the Cloud. The Scribe types on a keyboard... a descendant of the loom. He produces data at a rate of terabytes per second.

The Paradox... While the volume of memory has increased... the permanence has collapsed. The clay tablet lasted 4...000 years in the fire of Nineveh. The hard drive rots in five. We have entered the "Digital Dark Age." The Scribe writes on water... building a Library that burns as fast as it is built.
