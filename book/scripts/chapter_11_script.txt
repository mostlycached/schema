Chapter 11... The Coal Mine.

[exhales]
The Miner pays attention to the GAS. 
It is not one thing; it is a spectrum of death. 
The FIREDAMP... Methane... is lighter than air... accumulating in the roof of the tunnel. 
It is odorless... invisible... and highly explosive. 
A spark from a pickaxe can ignite it... causing a blast that travels at the speed of sound. 
Then there is BLACKDAMP... Carbon Dioxide and Nitrogen. 
It is heavier than air... pooling on the floor like an invisible ocean. 
It does not explode; it suffocates. 
It is the "Silent Killer."

[whispers]
The Miner pays attention to the CANARY. 
The bird is not a pet; it is a biological sensor. 
The canary has a metabolism ten times faster than a human's. 
If there is Carbon Monoxide in the air... the canary will sway on its perch long before the miner feels a headache. 
The miner watches the bird with the intensity of a mother watching a sick child. 
If the bird falls... everyone runs.

The Miner exists in the realm of the DAVY LAMP. 
Invented by Sir Humphry Davy... it is a lamp with a flame enclosed inside a fine wire mesh. 
The mesh acts as a flame arrestor. 
But it is also a gas detector. 
If the flame turns blue and elongates... there is Firedamp. 
If the flame dims and goes out... there is Blackdamp. 
The miner carries his life in a brass lantern.

[sighs]
But worlds... like stars... are subject to decay. 
The tension in the Miner's world is the Obsolescence. 
The world is turning away from coal. 
It is dirty... it is carbon-intensive... it is the enemy of the climate. 
The "Decay" is the closed pit... the rusted headframe... the town with no jobs. 
The miner is no longer the hero of labor; he is the villain of the environment.

[exhales]
The Miner steps out of the cage at the end of the shift. 
He is covered in black dust. 
The only white things are his eyes and his teeth. 
He pays attention to the SKY. 
To be a Miner is to appreciate the Surface. 
The air tastes sweet. 
He lights a cigarette... the flame flaring in the twilight. 
He looks at the smoke rising. 
He knows that down below... in the dark... the gas is waiting. 
But for now... he is out. 
He is alive.
