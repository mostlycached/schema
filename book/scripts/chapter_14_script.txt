Chapter 14... The Court Jester.

[laughs]
To understand the Jester... you must first understand the MAROTTE. 
It is his scepter... a stick topped with a carved head that looks exactly like him. 
It is a mirror on a stick. 
When the King speaks... the Jester consults the Marotte. 
He whispers to it... argues with it... and kisses it. 
It is a brilliant piece of theater... by talking to a doll... the Jester ignores the King. 
The Marotte is the only object in the room that is allowed to mock the crown.

[whispers]
The Jester pays attention to the SILENCE. 
The court is a noisy place... flattery... gossip... commands. 
But when the King makes a mistake... there is a specific kind of silence. 
It is the silence of fear. 
The Jester jumps into this silence. 
He is the only one who can break it. 
He pays attention to the LINE. 
There is an invisible line between "funny" and "treason." 
The Jester dances on this line. 
If he stays too far back... he is boring. 
If he crosses it... he loses his head.

The Jester exists in the realm of the MOTLEY. 
His clothes are a patchwork of colors... yellow... green... red. 
This is the anti-uniform. 
The King wears purple; the Jester wears chaos. 
The Jester is an outsider on the inside. 
He sleeps at the foot of the King's bed... like a dog. 
He knows the King's constipation... his impotence... his fears. 
He is the shadow of the monarch.

[sighs]
But the Jester is disappearing. 
The "Decay" is the rise of the Comedian. 
The Comedian is on a stage... separated from the audience. 
The Jester was IN the audience. 
The tension is between the Intimacy and the Performance. 
The Revolution is the end of the Jester. 
When the King's head is cut off... the Jester loses his job.

[whispers]
The Jester sits on the steps of the throne. 
The hall is empty. 
He takes off his cap. 
The bells jingle softly... a sad... lonely sound. 
He pays attention to the ECHO. 
To be a Jester is to be Sad. 
You are the smartest person in the room... pretending to be the stupidest. 
He looks at his Marotte. 
The wooden face smiles back at him... a frozen... painted grin. 
He realizes that he is the only one who is truly free... because he is the only one who knows that it is all a joke.
