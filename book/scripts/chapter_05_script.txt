Chapter 5... The Gondolier Guild.

[exhales]
The FORCOLA is not just an oarlock... it is a sculpture of walnut wood... carved to fit the specific height and reach of one man. 
It has no moving parts... yet it allows for eight different rowing positions. 
It is the elbow... the fulcrum... the brain of the boat.

The Gondolier pays attention to the FRICTION. 
He does not row against the water... he rows WITH it. 
He uses the FORCOLA to translate his linear force into a complex set of vectors... forward... backward... sideways... and rotational. 
He is piloting a 36-foot... 700-pound banana-shaped boat with a single oar... from one side... without a rudder. 
It is a physics problem that he solves with his body every second of the day.

[whispers]
The Gondolier pays attention to the MOTO ONDOSO... "Wave Motion." 
This is the enemy. 
It is the chaotic turbulence caused by motorboats... water taxis... and vaporetti. 
It eats the foundations of the palazzos. 
It makes the gondola unstable. 
The Gondolier reads the water like a topographic map. 
He sees the wake of a distant taxi and adjusts his stance before the wave even hits. 
He is a master of Balance.

The Gondolier exists in the realm of the SYMBOL. 
He is the logo of Venice. 
The striped shirt... the straw hat... the red ribbon. 
He is a walking postcard. 
But this visibility hides a deep habitus of exclusion. 
The Guild is a powerful union. 
There are only 433 licenses. 
They control the canals.

[sighs]
The city is dying. 
The population has dropped from 170,000 to under 50,000. 
The Venetians are leaving... driven out by high rents and the flood of tourists. 
The tension is between the Sacred Silence and the Profane Noise. 
The gondola was designed for a quiet city... a city where the only sound was the slap of water against stone. 
Now... the canals are a highway.

The Gondolier parks his boat at the traghetto. 
He wipes down the black varnish. 
He pays attention to the REFLECTION. 
To be a Gondolier is to live in a Hall of Mirrors. 
You are reflected in the water... in the windows of the palazzos... in the camera lenses of the tourists. 
He looks at the water. 
It is dirty... oily... churning. 
But underneath the surface... he knows the currents. 
He takes off his straw hat. 
He lights a cigarette. 
He watches the sun set over the Salute. 
For a moment... the motorboats stop. 
The water calms. 
The silence returns.
