Chapter 16... The Bodybuilder.

[exhales]
To understand the Bodybuilder... you must first understand the PEAK WEEK. 
It is a seven-day ritual of self-mummification. 
The Bodybuilder pays attention to the WATER. 
For months... he drinks two gallons a day. 
Then... 48 hours before the show... he stops. 
He enters a state of controlled dehydration. 
He wants the skin to be paper-thin... to "shrink-wrap" around the muscle. 
He sucks on ice cubes to keep his mouth moist. 
He is a man dying of thirst in a room full of water bottles.

The Bodybuilder pays attention to the TAN. 
It is not a sun tan; it is a chemical paint. 
It is thick... sticky... and gets everywhere. 
When he applies it... he ceases to be human and becomes a statue cast in bronze. 
He is no longer naked; he is covered in a layer of performance.

[whispers]
The Bodybuilder exists in the realm of the MANDATORY POSES. 
The Front Double Biceps... the Side Chest... the Rear Lat Spread. 
These are not random movements; they are a codified language. 
Every angle is calculated to hide weaknesses and highlight strengths.

[sighs]
But worlds... like stars... are subject to decay. 
The tension in the Bodybuilder's world is the DYSMORPHIA. 
The Bodybuilder is never big enough. 
The "Decay" is the mirror itself. 
When he looks in the mirror... he sees a skinny kid. 
He sees the flaws. 
The more muscle he builds... the smaller he feels. 
He is chasing a phantom physique that exists only in his head.

[exhales]
The Bodybuilder stands backstage. 
He is pumping up with resistance bands. 
He is sticky with oil. 
He is thirsty. 
He pays attention to the LIGHT. 
To be a Bodybuilder is to be Visible. 
He walks out onto the stage. 
The lights are blindingly bright. 
He hits the Front Lat Spread. 
He exhales... squeezing the air out of his lungs to show the striations in his intercostals. 
He feels the eyes of the judges on him. 
He is a sculpture that breathes. 
He is a monster of his own making. 
And for this one moment... under the lights... he is perfect.
