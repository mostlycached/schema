The Bodybuilder

This room is a Hall of Mirrors. The traveler sees a man standing before the glass... flexing an arm painted bronze. Two men exist here... the Man... who is weak and hungry... and the Image... which is a god of muscle and vein.

The Man looks at the Image and sees only flaws. The biceps is too flat... the calf is too small. He chases a phantom. "Bigorexia" is a hunger that cannot be fed. He eats the chicken... lifts the iron... injects the oil... all to feed the Image.

The Bodybuilder is Pygmalion... but he is also the statue. He carves his own flesh with pain. He strips away the fat to reveal the anatomy. "Shrink-wrapped." He becomes an anatomy chart that breathes.

The mirror judges him. Under the stage lights... the Man disappears completely. He freezes in the "Mandatory Pose." He smiles...a rictus of dehydration. For ten seconds... he is the Golden Calf. Then he exhales. The pump fades. The Image dissolves. He goes back to the gym... back to the mirror... to start rebuilding the ghost.
