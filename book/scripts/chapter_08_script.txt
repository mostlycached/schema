Chapter 8... The Bullfighting Ring.

[exhales]
The VERONICA is the fundamental pass of the cape. 
The matador holds the fabric with both hands... standing still as the bull charges. 
He does not move his feet. 
He moves only his arms... guiding the 500-kilogram beast past his body. 
The fabric brushes the bull's nose. 
The horn grazes the matador's thigh. 
It is named after Saint Veronica... who wiped the face of Christ on the way to Calvary. 
The matador is wiping the face of death.

[whispers]
He pays attention to the CHARGE. 
He is not fighting the bull; he is collaborating with it. 
He needs the bull to be brave... to be noble... to charge straight. 
If the bull is cowardly... there is no art... only butchery.

The Matador pays attention to the SILENCE. 
In a stadium of 20,000 screaming people... he listens for the breath of the bull. 
He listens for the scratching of hooves on the sand. 
He wears the "Suit of Lights"... a garment of silk and gold embroidery that takes six months to make. 
It is tight... like a second skin. 
It is a suit of armor made of thread.

[sighs]
But the world has changed. 
We no longer see the bullfight as a ritual; we see it as torture. 
The "Decay" is the empty seats in the arena. 
It is the realization that we are cheering for the suffering of a sentient being. 
The matador is no longer a hero; he is a relic... a barbarian in a suit of lights.

[whispers]
The Matador stands in the center of the ring. 
The bull is dead. 
The sand is stained dark. 
He pays attention to the APPLAUSE. 
To be a Matador is to be Post-Fear. 
You have walked through the fire and come out the other side. 
He looks at the dead bull being dragged away by the mules. 
He feels a profound sadness. 
He touches the gold embroidery on his jacket. 
It is wet with sweat and blood. 
He bows... not to the crowd... but to the empty space where the bull used to be.
