Chapter 2... The Jain Ascetic.

[exhales]
The MUHPATTI is a square of white cotton cloth... held over the mouth or tied behind the ears. 
To the outsider... it looks like a surgical mask... a precaution against disease. 
But the direction of protection is REVERSED. 
The doctor wears a mask to protect himself from the patient... the Jain wears a mask to protect the world from himself.

[whispers]
He pays attention to the BREATH. 
He knows that the air is not empty. 
It is a soup of life... microscopic organisms... NIGODAS... floating in the ether. 
Every inhale is a potential holocaust. 
The MUHPATTI is a filter... a shield designed to minimize the violence of simply existing.

This carefulness extends to the ground beneath his feet. 
He carries a RAJOHARANA... a broom made of soft white wool or cotton threads. 
Before he sits... before he sleeps... even before he takes a step... he sweeps the floor. 
He is not cleaning dirt... he is displacing life. 
He is ensuring that no ant... no mite... no invisible creature is crushed by the weight of his body.

This mode of attention is ancient... pre-dating Buddhism and perhaps even the Vedas. 
It is the most rigorous application of AHIMSA... Non-Violence... in human history. 
The Jain path is not about acquiring holiness... it is about shedding karma. 
Karma... in Jain physics... is not a metaphor. 
It is a subtle form of MATTER. 
It is "karmic dust" that sticks to the soul like dirt sticks to a wet cloth.

[serious]
Biology is violent. 
The immune system kills bacteria. 
The stomach digests living cells. 
To live is to kill. 
The Ascetic knows this. 
He knows that absolute AHIMSA is impossible as long as he has a body. 
This creates a tragic tension... he is striving for a zero-impact existence in a high-impact reality.

The most profound tension is the legal status of SALLEKHANA. 
This is the final vow... the voluntary fast unto death. 
When the body is old or diseased and can no longer serve the soul... the Ascetic stops eating. 
He gradually reduces his intake... solid food... then liquid... then water... until he leaves the body behind. 
To the secular law... this looks like suicide. 
To the Jain... it is the ultimate triumph. 
It is not an act of despair... but an act of cleaning.

[whispers]
The Ascetic sits in the monastery. 
It is sunset. 
He pays attention to the SILENCE. 
To be a Jain Ascetic is to be a Ghost in the Machine. 
You are in the world... but not of it. 
He lies down on the hard floor... on a thin mat. 
He pulls the white sheet over his head. 
He is a corpse practicing for death. 
He closes his eyes and watches the karma burning off his soul... like sparks flying from a fire... disappearing into the dark... cool night.
