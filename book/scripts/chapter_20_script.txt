The Glassblower

In the beginning... this room was Fire. The Sand (Silica) met the Ash (Soda) in the belly of the furnace. It melted. It became a liquid sun... roaring at 2...000 degrees.

In 1291... the Doge of Venice banished the furnaces to an island... fearing fire in the wooden city. Since then... the Glassblowers have been hostages of their own art. They were forbidden to leave the island on pain of death. They were the masters of the "Crystal..." the clear glass that looked like solid water.

The tool is the Pipe. The Glassblower dips the iron into the lava. He gathers the "blob." He blows. The breath of the man enters the body of the glass. It swells. He spins it... fighting gravity. It is a dance with time... the glass wants to drip... to freeze... to crack.

The fragility is the "Decay." The totem is Prince Rupert's Drop. A tadpole of glass dripped into water. The head is invincible... the tail is the flaw. Snap the tail... and the whole thing explodes into dust. Every vase is a bomb waiting to go off.

The Glassblower puts the piece in the Annealer to cool slowly. The red fades to clear. The fire is gone. The movement is frozen. He holds the goblet. It is cold... hard... and sharp. It is "Solid Breath." It is a memory of the fire that made it... trapped in a shape that will last for a thousand years... or break in a second.
