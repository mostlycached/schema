Chapter 9... The Tea Ceremony.

[whispers]
The SUMI... charcoal... is not just fuel; it is a landscape. 
The Master arranges the pieces in the brazier with the precision of a jeweler. 
He uses metal chopsticks to place each piece so that the air flows perfectly... creating a heat that is intense but silent. 
He pays attention to the SOUND. 
The water in the iron kettle must not boil violently; it must simmer. 
The sound is described as "wind in the pines." 
It is a white noise that drowns out the chaos of the world and pulls the guests into a shared trance.

[exhales]
The Master pays attention to the IMPERFECTION. 
He holds a tea bowl that is rough... asymmetrical... perhaps even cracked and repaired with gold lacquer. 
This is the aesthetic of WABI-SABI. 
It is the beauty of things that are imperfect... impermanent... and incomplete. 
A perfect porcelain cup is boring; it has no story. 
A rough... hand-molded clay bowl has a soul.

The Tea Master exists in the realm of the SEASON. 
The tea ceremony is a clock that tells the time of year. 
The Master changes the scroll on the wall... the flowers in the vase... and the sweets to match the season. 
In April... the sweet might be shaped like a cherry blossom petal. 
In October... it might look like a fallen maple leaf.

[sighs]
But the tea ceremony takes time. 
A full formal gathering can last four hours. 
The tension is the Speed of Life. 
We drink tea from plastic bottles. 
We drink coffee in paper cups while running to catch a train. 
The tea ceremony is becoming a performance for tourists... a "cultural experience" squeezed into a 30-minute slot.

[whispers]
The Master sits in the tea room. 
The guests have gone. 
The charcoal is dying in the brazier. 
He pays attention to the EMPTY BOWL. 
To be a Tea Master is to be Empty. 
You empty your mind of ego... of worry... of ambition. 
He picks up the bamboo scoop and wipes it with a silk cloth. 
He bows to the empty room. 
The silence is heavy... pregnant with the memory of the conversation. 
He extinguishes the charcoal. 
The wind in the pines stops. 
The world returns.
