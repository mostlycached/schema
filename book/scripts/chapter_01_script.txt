Chapter 1... The Tuareg Caravan.

[exhales]
To understand the Tuareg... you must first understand the TAGELMUST.

It is not a piece of clothing... it is a piece of ARCHITECTURE. 
In the phenomenology of the Sahara... where the sun is a physical WEIGHT... and the wind is a sanding belt... this length of indigo-dyed cotton is the only wall you have. 
It creates a private... ontologically secure space for the self... in a landscape that is otherwise aggressively infinite.

[whispers]
The "Blue Men of the Desert"... are defined by this boundary. 
The dye is beaten into the fabric with such force that it bleeds onto the skin... staining the face a deep... permanent blue. 
This is not a metaphor. 
It is a somatic intervention. 
The desert enters the pores.

The Tuareg pays attention to this boundary... the line where the self ends... and the silica begins... with a vigilance that defines his entire existence. 
He knows that to let the desert in... is to die. 
But to shut it out completely... is to starve. 
He must be a semi-permeable membrane... filtering the world through the indigo mesh.

This wrapping is a ritual of manhood... a rite of passage that begins at puberty. 
The veil can be ten meters long... a complex topography of folds that signals clan... status... and mood. 
To the uninitiated... it is a mask. 
To the Tuareg... it is a face.

The "Kel Tagelmust"... the People of the Veil... believe that the mouth and nose are portals of vulnerability... entry points for DJINN... and exit points for the soul. 
To expose the mouth... is to be naked. 
To drink tea... the veil is lifted slightly. 
To eat... it is adjusted. 
The fabric is a second skin... a social filter that regulates the flow of speech... and breath.

But the TAGELMUST is also a technology of attention. 
It narrows the field of vision. 
It forces the eyes to focus. 
In the desert... wide vision is useless; the horizon is a hallucination. 
Focused vision is survival. 
You do not look at the whole; you look at the sign. 
The shift in the ripple of the sand... the slight darkening of the blue sky that signals a storm... the track of a viper. 
The veil turns the Tuareg into a camera... with the aperture closed down to f/64. 
Everything is sharp. 
Everything is significant.
