Chapter 15... The Executioner.

[exhales]
To understand the Executioner... you must first understand the SWORD. 
It is not a weapon of war; it is a surgical instrument. 
The blade is broad... flat... and blunt at the tip. 
It is designed for one thing only... to sever the cervical vertebrae in a single blow. 
The Executioner pays attention to the INSCRIPTION. 
Etched into the steel is a prayer: 
"When I raise this sword... so I wish that this poor sinner will receive eternal life." 
It is a paradox forged in iron... the instrument of death is also the vessel of mercy.

The Executioner pays attention to the HAVAGE. 
This is his right to take a handful of grain or a slice of meat from the market vendors without paying. 
It sounds like a perk... but it is a curse. 
The vendors do not want his money. 
His coins are considered "blood money." 
If he touches the food... it is contaminated. 
He is a ghost who eats the surplus of the living.

[whispers]
The Executioner exists in the realm of the BRAND. 
For minor crimes... he does not kill; he marks. 
He heats the iron until it is red. 
He presses it into the shoulder or the cheek. 
The smell of burning flesh is the smell of his office. 
The Executioner is a healer. 
Because he knows anatomy better than anyone else... he is often sought out to set broken bones or cure skin diseases. 
He is a shaman of the macabre.

[sighs]
But worlds... like stars... are subject to decay. 
The tension in the Executioner's world is the Mechanization of Death. 
The sword is an artisan's tool. 
It requires skill... strength... and nerve. 
The "Decay" is the arrival of the Guillotine. 
The machine does not get tired. 
It does not get nervous. 
It does not miss. 
The Executioner becomes a machine operator. 
He pulls a lever. 
The art is gone.

[exhales]
The Executioner stands on the scaffold. 
The sun is rising. 
The crowd is silent. 
He pays attention to the NECK. 
To be an Executioner is to be Focus. 
You cannot think about the man's family. 
You cannot think about his crime. 
You can only think about the vertebrae. 
He draws the sword. 
The steel hisses against the velvet. 
He steps forward. 
He swings. 
For a split second... he is the most powerful man in the world. 
He is the hand of God.
