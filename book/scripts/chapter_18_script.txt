Chapter 18... The Perfumer.

[exhales]
To understand the Perfumer... you must first understand the FAT. 
This is the ancient technique of ENFLEURAGE. 
It is a cold... silent process. 
A glass plate is coated with a layer of odorless pork and beef fat. 
Fresh jasmine flowers are pressed into the fat... face down. 
They sit there for 48 hours... screaming their scent into the grease. 
The fat becomes a "pomade"... saturated with the souls of ten thousand flowers.

[whispers]
The Perfumer pays attention to the MOLECULE. 
He does not just smell "rose"; he smells "Phenyl Ethyl Alcohol." 
He does not just smell "wood"; he smells ISO E SUPER. 
This synthetic molecule is a ghost. 
It is too large to be smelled by some people. 
To others... it smells like velvet... like human skin... like a pheromone. 
He is a chemist of the invisible.

The Perfumer exists in the realm of the HEADSPACE. 
This is the technology of theft. 
A glass bell jar is placed over a living flower. 
A vacuum pump sucks the air out through a carbon filter. 
The Perfumer can now recreate the smell of a rare orchid without ever picking it. 
He dreams in formulas.

[sighs]
But the tension in the Perfumer's world is the IFRA. 
The International Fragrance Association regulates the industry. 
Every year... they ban more ingredients. 
Oakmoss is allergenic? Banned. 
Clove oil? Restricted. 
The "Decay" is the loss of the palette. 
The Perfumer is a painter whose colors are being taken away.

[whispers]
The Perfumer sits at his "Organ." 
He dips a paper strip into a vial. 
He waves it under his nose. 
He pays attention to the DRY DOWN. 
To be a Perfumer is to be Patient. 
He smells the Jasmine Absolute. 
It is floral... yes... but deep down... there is a note of "Indole"... a molecule also found in feces. 
It is the smell of decay... of death... rotting at the heart of the flower. 
He smiles. 
He knows that beauty is not just sweetness; it is the tension between the flower and the beast. 
He bottles the rot... calls it "Desire"... and sells it to the world.
