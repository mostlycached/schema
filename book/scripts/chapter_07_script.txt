Chapter 7... The Falconer.

[whispers]
The HOOD is a small leather helmet... often tooled with exquisite patterns and topped with a plume of feathers. 
It covers the bird's eyes completely. 
To the uninitiated... it looks like a form of cruelty... a blinding. 
To the Falconer... it is an act of mercy. 
The raptor is a visual creature; its eyes are ten times more powerful than a human's. 
It sees everything... the movement of a mouse a mile away... the flicker of a lightbulb... the fear in your eyes. 
The hood turns off the world. 
It gives the bird the gift of darkness.

[exhales]
The Falconer pays attention to the WEIGHT. 
He does not measure his bird's health by its mood... but by its mass... down to the gram. 
He weighs the bird every morning on a digital scale. 
If the bird is too heavy... it will not hunt. 
If it is too light... it will be weak. 
He is looking for the "Flying Weight"... the precise metabolic edge where hunger sharpens the instinct but does not dull the muscle. 
He is an engineer of starvation.

The Falconer exists in the realm of the SKY. 
He is a terrestrial animal who dreams of flight. 
He projects his consciousness into the bird. 
When the falcon stoops... diving at 200 miles per hour... the Falconer feels the wind in his own face.

[sighs]
But the raptor needs space. 
A peregrine falcon needs a sky without power lines... without drones... without glass skyscrapers. 
The Falconer drives for hours to find a field that hasn't been turned into a parking lot. 
He is a hunter with nowhere to hunt.

[whispers]
The Falconer stands in a wheat field. 
It is late afternoon. 
He pays attention to the SILENCE. 
To be a Falconer is to be Waiting. 
He raises his fist. 
The peregrine is a weight on his arm... a bundle of potential energy. 
He pulls the braces of the hood with his teeth. 
The hood opens. 
He casts the bird off. 
It climbs... ringing up into the sky... smaller and smaller... until it is just a speck of dust against the sun. 
The Falconer stands rooted to the earth... holding his breath... waiting for the moment when the speck turns over and becomes a thunderbolt. 
He is not watching the bird; he IS the bird.
