The Falconer

This room is defined by a thread. You feel the tension on your arm... though you hold nothing. The Falconer stands still... his fist protected by a thick leather gauntlet. On it sits the Peregrine... a city of potential violence wrapped in feathers.

The hood is a masterpiece of leather and gold. It creates a portable night... blinding the bird to keep its visual cortex from exploding. The Falconer and the bird exist in a symbiosis of "Sensory Deprivation." The man sees for the bird... the bird flies for the man.

The release removes the wall. The world explodes into the bird's eye...a high-resolution map of movement. The bird launches. The relationship stretches into a thin... invisible geometry across the sky. That geometry is Trust. If the bird decides to fly away... the man is empty. He possesses only influence... never control.

The King serves the Beast. The Falconer wakes at 3 AM to feed the bird. He weighs it on a digital scale to find the "Hunting Weight..." a razor's edge of hunger. One ounce too heavy... and the bird ignores him... one ounce too light... and it falls.

The bird dives...the stoop. 200 miles per hour. A blur of physics. The impact thuds in your stomach. The Falconer runs... offering the lure. The bird steps back onto the glove. The hood returns. The violence goes back into the box... sleeping until tomorrow.
