Chapter 19... The Watchmaker.

[exhales]
To understand the Watchmaker... you must first understand the ESCAPEMENT. 
It is the heart of the machine... the mechanism that slices time into discrete units. 
The Watchmaker pays attention to the TICK. 
It is not a single sound; it is a complex mechanical event. 
Tick-tock-tick-tock. 
28,800 vibrations per hour. 
The Watchmaker listens for the "beat error"... the tiny asymmetry between the tick and the tock. 
A perfect watch sounds like a steady heartbeat; a flawed one sounds like a limp.

[whispers]
The Watchmaker pays attention to the FRICTION. 
Friction is the enemy of time. 
It wears down the pivots; it thickens the oil. 
The Watchmaker fights a war against entropy using microscopic drops of lubricant. 
He is a hydraulic engineer working on a scale of millimeters.

The Watchmaker exists in the realm of the TOURBILLON. 
It is a cage that rotates the escapement 360 degrees once a minute. 
Its purpose is to cancel out the effects of gravity. 
But the Watchmaker loves it because it is beautiful. 
It is a kinetic sculpture... a mechanical heart beating on the wrist. 
The Watchmaker lives in a world of magnification. 
He wears a Loupe pressed into his eye socket. 
He sees dust motes as boulders.

[sighs]
But worlds... like stars... are subject to decay. 
The tension in the Watchmaker's world is the QUARTZ CRISIS. 
The "Decay" is the obsolescence of the mechanical. 
Why spend $50,000 on a watch that loses 2 seconds a day when a $10 Casio is perfect? 
The Watchmaker is fighting for the soul of the machine against the cold logic of the circuit board.

[whispers]
The Watchmaker sits at his bench. 
It is late. 
The workshop is quiet... except for the ticking of a hundred clocks. 
He pays attention to the MAINSPRING. 
To be a Watchmaker is to be Immortal. 
You are building something that will outlive you. 
He winds the watch. 
He puts the watch to his ear. 
He closes his eyes. 
He is not listening to a machine; he is listening to time itself... captured in a cage of brass and steel... beating against the silence of eternity.
