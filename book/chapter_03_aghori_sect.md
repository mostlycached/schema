# The Aghori Sect

This room is built of negative space. It sits in the blind spot of the holy city, on the burning ghats where the fires never go out. While the rest of the world seeks Purity, the Aghori constructs his sanctuary out of Filth.

Cleanliness here is a sin. The traveler finds a man eating from a bowl that is the top half of a human skull—the *Kapala*. He sleeps on a bed of charnel ash. He meditates sitting on a floating corpse. He proves, through the geometry of his own body, that there is no difference between the living and the dead.

God is in the feces as much as in the flower. To reject the filth is to reject the Divine. The Aghori consumes the "Left Hand" path, breaking every taboo to shatter the dualism of the mind. The horror you feel is simply the lock on your own enlightenment.

He covers himself in the grey dust of the crematorium—the *Vibhuti*. He wears the final product of humanity. He forces you to look at the mirror of mortality.

Yet the room is leaking. Tourists come with cameras to photograph the "Cannibal Monks," turning the shock into a commodity. The struggle lies between true Transgression and Performative Madness. The Aghori sits by the fire, holding the skull, laughing at the joke: you are the prisoner in the cage of "clean," while he sits in the mud, completely free.
