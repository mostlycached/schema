# The Aghori Sect

The *Kapala* is a human skull, severed at the brow, turned upside down to form a cup. To the uninitiated, it is an object of supreme horror, a desecration of the dead. To the Aghori, it is the only honest bowl in the world. He eats from it. He drinks from it. He begs with it. He pays attention to the Bone. He knows that this calcium shell once held a universe of thoughts, fears, and loves, and now it holds his lentil soup. The *Kapala* is a somatic intervention that forces the user to kiss death every time he nourishes life. It is the ultimate rejection of the "Yuck Factor."

The Aghori pays attention to the Pollution. In the orthodox Hindu caste system, purity is the currency. You stay away from the lower castes, from the dead, from bodily fluids. The Aghori runs towards them. He lives in the *Shmashana* (cremation ground), the most polluted place on earth. He smears his body with the ashes of the pyre (*Bhasma*). He eats feces. He eats rotting flesh fished from the Ganges. He is not doing this to be shocking; he is doing it to break the binary of Pure/Impure. He believes that if God (Shiva) is everywhere, then God is in the shit as much as in the temple. To reject the filth is to reject a part of God.

This mode of attention is a dark tributary of the great river of Shaivism. It traces its lineage to the *Kapalikas* ("Skull-Bearers") of the medieval period, but the modern tradition was solidified by Baba Kinaram in the 17th century. The genealogy is one of Non-Duality (*Advaita*). The Aghori takes the philosophical concept of "All is One" and tests it in the laboratory of the physical world. If all is one, then there is no difference between a delicious meal and a piece of human flesh. The distinction exists only in the mind, created by *Maya* (illusion) and social conditioning. The Aghori is a "Radical Monist." He is trying to deprogram his own brain, to short-circuit the biological disgust response that keeps us trapped in the illusion of duality.

The Aghori exists in the realm of the Taboo. He is the "Left-Hand Path" (*Vamachara*) of Tantra. While the Right-Hand Path uses mantras and visualization, the Left-Hand Path uses the "Five Ms": Alcohol, Meat, Fish, Parched Grain, and Sexual Intercourse. But the Aghori takes these further. His meat is carrion. His alcohol is consumed from a skull. This creates a unique *Habitus*. The Aghori is often naked or wears only a jute loincloth. His hair is matted into dreadlocks. His eyes are often red from smoking *Ganja*, which he considers a sacrament to Shiva. He sits by the *Dhuni* (sacred fire), which represents the digestive power of the universe.

The ritual of *Shava Sadhana* is the apex of this habitus. It is the "Corpse Meditation." On a new moon night, in the middle of the cremation ground, the Aghori finds a fresh corpse. He washes it. He invokes the spirit of the deceased. He sits on the chest of the corpse and meditates. He is trying to wake up the "Corpse" of his own consciousness. He is confronting the ultimate reality of his own mortality. If he succeeds, he gains control over the spirit world. If he fails—if he gets scared—legend says the corpse will devour him, or he will go mad.

But the Aghori has become a tourist attraction. In Varanasi, you can find "fake" Aghoris who will pose for photos with a skull for ten rupees. The tension is between the Saint and the Cannibal. The public perception oscillates between reverence and revulsion. They are feared as black magicians who can curse you, but they are also sought out as healers. The *Krim-Kund* is famous for its healing pond, where people come to be cured of leprosy and infertility. The Aghori is the "Sin-Eater" of the society. He takes on the pollution that others cannot handle.

The legal status of the sect is precarious. While the Indian Constitution protects religious freedom, the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act (2013) explicitly criminalizes some of their rituals. The consumption of human flesh, even if scavenged and not killed, teeters on the edge of the law. The Aghori exists in a legal grey zone, tolerated because of his spiritual power, but constantly threatened by the "Sanitization" of the modern state.

The Aghori is a Psychonaut of Disgust. By exposing himself to the pathogens of the physical and social world, he builds a spiritual immune system that is invincible. He proves that "Purity" is a weakness because it is fragile. "Impurity" is strength because it can absorb anything. The *Kapala* evolves into the Grail. It is the cup that holds the elixir of life, which is the knowledge of death. The *Shmashana* evolves into the Real World. The Aghori argues that the city, with its lies and its commerce and its vanity, is the illusion. The cremation ground, where everyone ends up as a pile of ash, is the only place where the truth is told.

The Aghori sits by the Ganges. The pyres are burning at Manikarnika Ghat. The smell of burning flesh is thick in the air. He pays attention to the Smoke. To be an Aghori is to be Post-Human. You have stepped out of the game of society. You have no caste, no family, no shame. You are a wild animal that has remembered it is God. He picks up his Kapala. He dips it into the river. He drinks the water, which is full of ashes and bacteria and flowers. He wipes his mouth. He looks at the tourists on the boat, taking pictures of him with their zoom lenses. They see a monster. He sees God in drag. He laughs, a loud, cackling laugh that echoes off the stone steps. He throws a handful of ash into the air. "Jai Mahakal!" he shouts. Victory to the Great Time, the devourer of all things. He lies down on the warm stone, wraps himself in his dog-skin blanket, and falls asleep, cradled in the arms of the Mother who eats her own children.
