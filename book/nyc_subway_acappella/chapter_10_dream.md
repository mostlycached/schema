# The Dream Commute

This car measures exactly fifty-one feet. You have been riding for hours.

You boarded at 14th Street. You were going to 42nd. The train passed 42nd and you did not exit. You do not know why. The doors opened and your body did not move. You watched yourself stay seated. You could not intervene.

The train continues uptown. The stops are wrong. 72nd. 96th. 116th. You should get off. You should ask someone. But the faces around you are familiar—too familiar. The woman reading the tabloid is your mother. Your mother has been dead for six years. The man sleeping in the corner is your first boss at your first job. He fired you in 1997.

You close your eyes. When you open them, the train is crossing water. You can see it through the windows: black water, waves. The tunnel has become a bridge. The bridge has become a ferry. The subway car is floating.

No one else notices. They check their phones. They read their papers. The woman who is your mother turns the page and does not look up.

You try to speak. Your voice does not work. You try to stand. Your legs do not obey. This is the commute. This is the commute you have always taken. The stations are wrong because they were never right.

The train descends. The water closes over the windows. The car fills with green light. You are underwater. You have always been underwater. The commute is a loop. The loop is a dream. The dream is the only life you have ever known.

You wake up.

You are in your bed. The alarm is sounding. It is 6:15 AM. In thirty minutes you will descend the stairs. In forty minutes you will board the train. In forty-five minutes you will pass 42nd Street and you will exit, as you always do, as you always have.

But tonight, when you sleep, you will be on the train again. The train that never stops. The train that carries you through water, through memory, through the dark.

Stand clear of the closing doors. The doors are always closing. The doors will close forever.
