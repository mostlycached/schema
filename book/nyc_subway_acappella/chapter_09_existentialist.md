# The Existentialist Commute

This car measures exactly fifty-one feet. It contains twenty-three people. In eighty years, all of them will be dead.

You stand in the center of the car and count the faces. The woman with the newspaper will die. The man with the briefcase will die. The child holding his mother's hand—even the child, one day, will die. The train carries the dead. The train has always carried the dead.

And yet they read their papers. They check their phones. They worry about rent, about promotions, about whether they remembered to lock the door. They do not see what you see: the skull beneath the skin, the coffin beneath the car, the darkness at the end of every tunnel.

The train moves through the void. Above you, the sun shines on a city that believes in permanence. Skyscrapers, monuments, empires. All of them will fall. The bedrock beneath Manhattan will become ocean again. The subway will rust and flood and be forgotten.

You hold the pole. The pole is cold. The pole was installed by someone who is dead. It will be gripped by someone not yet born. You are a moment in the pole's history, a hand among ten thousand hands.

The announcement comes: "Next stop, Times Square." But what does "next" mean when time is an illusion? What does "stop" mean when the train is always moving, even when it stands still?

You exit. You climb. You emerge into the light.

The city swarms around you. Everyone is rushing. Everyone believes that arrival matters, that the meeting will save them, that the deadline has meaning. You watch them run and you feel something like love—not for them, but for their delusion, for the faith that carries them forward into annihilation.

You light a cigarette. You are going to die. So is the cigarette. So is the match.

Tomorrow you will ride again. The train will be the same. The faces will be different, but they will die just the same. You will ride with them into the dark and out again, forever, until you don't.

This is the existentialist commute. This is Sisyphus with a MetroCard. This is you, absurd, mortal, present.

Stand clear of the closing doors.
