# The Descent

This staircase measures exactly thirty-two steps. Each step takes you further from the sky.

You stand at the top, briefcase in hand, watching the stream of bodies descend. They move without hesitation. They have done this before. They will do it again. For them, the descent is nothing—a transition, a corridor, a means to an end.

For you, the descent is a crossing.

The air changes at Step 7. The warmth of the street gives way to something older, something damp. The light changes at Step 14. The sun disappears. The fluorescents take over—green, flickering, institutional.

You descend.

At the bottom, a musician plays saxophone. The sound ricochets off tile walls, becomes something larger than itself. A melody written for concert halls, performed in a corridor, heard by no one who stops.

You swipe your card. The turnstile clicks. You push through.

The platform smells of iron and heat and something else—something human, something that cannot be scrubbed away. Generations of breath compressed into stone. You stand at the yellow line and wait.

Above you, the city continues. Cars honk. Dogs bark. People sit in offices and look out windows. None of them know you are here, thirty feet below, waiting in the dark for a train that may or may not arrive.

The headlight appears in the tunnel. You feel the wind first, then the noise.

The train is here. You step forward. You leave the upper world behind.

This is the descent. This is the daily death. You go underground because the underground goes where you need to go. But each time you descend, you leave something at the top—a piece of yourself that belongs to the light, a version of you that never has to stand on a platform waiting for a machine to carry you through the dark.

You enter the car. The doors close. The descent is complete.
