# The First Day

This car measures exactly fifty-one feet. You do not know this yet. You do not know anything yet.

The map above the door is a maze of colored veins. You stare at it, tracing lines with your finger in the air. A woman watches you. She knows you are new. Everyone knows you are new. Your shoes are wrong. Your bag is wrong. The way you hold the pole is wrong.

The train lurches and you stumble. No one offers a hand. Hands are for strangers, and you are not a stranger—you are a commuter now. You are supposed to have mastered this by the time you set foot on the platform. You have not.

Which door puts you closest to the exit? You do not know. Which car is safest? You do not know. When the announcement says "downtown," does it mean downtown to you, or downtown to them, and who are they?

A man pushes past you. He does not say excuse me. He does not need to. He belongs here. The train is his body and he moves through it like blood. You are the clot.

Your stop is next. Or is it? The sign said 14th Street but this looks like 23rd. Did you miss it? Did the train skip? Are you on the express? What is the express?

The doors open. You exit. You are wrong. This is not your stop. The doors close behind you.

You stand on the platform, the wrong platform, watching the train disappear into the tunnel. The day has not started. The day is already over. You look at the map on the wall. You start again.

Eventually, you will know. Eventually, your body will move without thinking. Eventually, you will be the blood instead of the clot. But not today. Today you are learning that New York does not teach. It only tests.
