# The Packed Car

This car measures exactly fifty-one feet. You enter as a single body and become a cell.

The doors hiss closed behind you. You cannot move backward. You can only press forward into the mass. A shoulder blade against your chest. An elbow in your ribs. Someone's breath on the back of your neck—coffee, cigarette, mint.

You do not know whose bag is pressing into your thigh. You do not turn to look. Looking is an act of aggression in a space this dense. You stare at the advertisement above the window: a lawyer promising justice, a dentist promising teeth. Your eyes have nowhere else to go.

The train lurches. The mass sways as one organism. You feel the weight of the man behind you shift, feel his balance become your problem. For a moment your bodies are synchronized—a hundred strangers breathing in the same rhythm, gripping the same poles, wishing for the same stops.

A woman near the door is crying. You can hear the sniffles. No one looks. Looking would require acknowledging that she is a person, and in this density, personhood is a luxury the car cannot afford.

Your stop is in six minutes. You begin calculating: which way will the crowd move, which door is closest to the stairs, how many elbows will you take to the sternum before you reach air.

The doors open. You do not exit. Bodies press in from the platform. The car swallows more souls. The density increases beyond what should be physics. And yet.

You descend into the mass. You become less than yourself. This is the commute. This is the daily practice of being nobody. Stand clear of the closing doors.
