# The Whaling Ship

This room floats on blood. It is an Attempt at Exhausting a Slaughterhouse.

Item: One wooden ship, the *Pequod*, smelling of rancid oil.
Item: Three masts scraping the grey sky.
Item: Try-works (brick furnaces) built on the deck, burning the blubber of the whale to boil the oil of the whale. The fire acts as a cannibal, fed by the body of the victim.

Item: One Harpoon. Iron. Cold. Barbed.
Item: One "Nantucket Sleighride"—the rope singing smoke as the leviathan drags the boat towards the horizon.

Item: The Flensing Knives, long and spade-shaped.
Item: The Blanket Piece, a strip of skin and fat peeled like an orange rind.
Item: The Case. The head of the Sperm Whale, a tank containing 500 gallons of *Spermaceti*—liquid light. A man stands waist-deep in the brain of the beast to bucket it out.

Item: The Economy. The oil lights the lamps of London and Paris. The civilization of the Enlightenment glows with the murder of monsters.

Item: The ocean. Indifferent. Flat.
Item: The silence after the whale sounds.
Item: The red wake.
