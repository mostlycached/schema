# The Prose Style Guide: Constraint-Driven Rooms

This document defines the strict rhetorical and structural rules for the "constraint-driven" prose style used in this book.

## I. The Core Philosophy
We do not describe "Cities"; we describe **Rooms**.
We do not report "Facts" from `WORLDS.md`; we derive **Consequences** from the laws of the Room.
We do not use **Meta-Commentary**; the technique must be invisible.

## II. The Three Commandments (The "Shakespeare Rules")

### 1. The Room Frame
*   **Rule**: The primary unit of the world is the *Enclosed Space* (The Room, The Cell, The Pocket).
*   **Framing**: Start the chapter by defining the physical limits of this room.
*   **Examples**:
    *   *Correct*: "This room fits within the circumference of a brass ring." (Watchmaker)
    *   *Correct*: "This room measures exactly four and a half mats." (Tea)
    *   *Incorrect*: "The city of the Watchmaker is a miniature world."

### 2. Direct Assertion (No Negation)
*   **Rule**: Banish the structure "It is not X, but Y." This is defensive writing. State what the thing *is*.
*   **Examples**:
    *   *Incorrect*: "The Tagelmust is not a scarf; it is a wall."
    *   *Correct*: "The Tagelmust wraps ten times around the skull, creating a portable room."
    *   *Incorrect*: "He is not a man; he is a void."
    *   *Correct*: "He is a void shaped like a man."

### 3. No Meta-Commentary
*   **Rule**: Never explain the logic of the world. State the reality. Do not references the archetype.
*   **Examples**:
    *   *Incorrect*: "Because this is a Parable, time is circular."
    *   *Correct*: "Time here travels in a circle."
    *   *Incorrect*: "The tension is between the inside and outside."
    *   *Correct*: "The door must remain locked to keep the Mystery in."

## III. The Generation Process

1.  **Identify the Constraint**: What is the physical law of this Room? (e.g., "Miniature," "Vertical," "Loop").
2.  **Derive the Consequences**:
    *   *If Miniature* -> Gravity is weak, Adhesion is strong.
    *   *If Vertical* -> The bottom is older than the top.
    *   *If Loop* -> The end is the beginning.
3.  **Assert the Reality**: Write these consequences as absolute facts.

## IV. Rhetorical Patterns to Avoid
*   "To understand X, you must..." (Too instructional/meta).
*   "The genealogy is..." (Banned).
*   "The Doxa is..." (Banned).
*   "The tension is..." (Banned).
*   Passive Voice ("The city is built by..."). Use Active Voice ("The city roots into the earth...").
