# Chapter Structure Template

Based on the analysis of "Seeking Attention", each chapter should follow this general flow, weaving in specific elements from `WORLDS.md` and the Optimization analysis.

## 0. The Visual Hook (Realistic Image)
*   **Placement**: At the very top of the chapter.
*   **Style**: Hyper-realistic, National Geographic style photography.
*   **Content**: A portrait of the "Type" in their natural environment, emphasizing lighting, texture, and the "mode of attention" (e.g., eyes, hands).

## 1. The Hook (The Mode of Attention)
*   **Purpose**: Define the "Type" by how they pay attention or exist in the world.
*   **Style**: Direct, essayistic, slightly provocative.
*   **Key Phrase**: "The [Type] pays attention to..." or "To understand the [Type], one must..."
*   **World Data**: Use the **Phenomenology** and **Binary Code** here.

## 2. The Genealogy (Deep Time)
*   **Purpose**: Place the type in historical context. Show that they are not new, or if they are, where they came from.
*   **Style**: Broad historical sweep, evolutionary psychology, or anthropological observation.
*   **World Data**: Use the **Genealogy** field.
*   **Required Element**: A reference to a historical origin (e.g., "Since the time of Hippocrates...", "In the ancient salt mines...").

## 3. The Cultural Web (Quotes, Literature, Philosophy)
*   **Purpose**: Ground the type in the broader canon of human thought. Connect the specific world to universal themes.
*   **Style**: Intellectual, associative.
*   **Required Elements**:
    *   **Literary Reference**: A novel, poem, or play that features this type (e.g., *Dune*, *The Sheltering Sky*, Camus).
    *   **Philosophical Concept**: A specific thinker or concept (e.g., Heidegger's *The They*, Bourdieu's *Habitus*, Deleuze's *Nomadology*).
    *   **Myth/Parable**: A classical myth or a constructed fable that illustrates the type's core conflict.

## 4. The Tension (The Glitch)
*   **Purpose**: Describe the crisis the world is facing. Why is it interesting *now*?
*   **Style**: Journalistic, diagnostic.
*   **World Data**: Use the **Tension** field (Decay, Mutation, Crisis).
*   **Required Element**: A specific modern anecdote or observation (e.g., the GPS, the border guard, the specific law).

## 5. The Visual Optimization (Sketch Image)
*   **Placement**: Before the "Optimization" section.
*   **Style**: Simple, minimalistic pencil sketch on white paper. Hand-drawn, raw, "field notebook" aesthetic.
*   **Content**: An abstract or conceptual fusion of the traditional world and the optimized future (e.g., camel merging with truck).

## 6. The Optimization (The Evolution)
*   **Purpose**: Show how the world is adapting. This is the core of our unique value add.
*   **Style**: Analytical, speculative, "The Glitch as Feature".
*   **World Data**: Use the **Iteration** field and the **Optimization Analysis** (Techniques, Values).
*   **Key Elements**:
    *   **Somatic Intervention**: How the body changes (e.g., the indigo stain).
    *   **Technological Mutation**: The new tool (e.g., the Toyota Hilux).

## 7. The Phenomenological Conclusion
*   **Purpose**: Return to the subjective experience. Leave the reader with the *feeling* of the world.
*   **Style**: Poetic, evocative, summarizing.
*   **World Data**: Return to **Phenomenology** and **Ontological Security**.
*   **Closing Image**: A lingering sensory detail (e.g., the taste of the tea, the blue skin).
