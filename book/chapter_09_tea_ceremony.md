# The Tea Ceremony

This room measures exactly four and a half mats. The Citizen is an error that must be corrected. The Tea Ceremony is an algorithm for the annihilation of the Self.

The *Nijiriguchi* (crawl door) enforces the posture of the insect. You enter as a component of the room. The individual will is too large for this space; you leave it outside with the shoes.

The wiping of the bowl, the turning of the whisk, the folding of the cloth—these are coordinates. To deviate from the coordinate is to fall off the edge of the world. The Host executes a code. *Whish, whish.* The foam mirrors the silence of the mind.

"Flavor" is irrelevant. The tea is green and bitter, but you swallow the rules. The bowl is a void that you hold in your hands. You turn it twice to admire the flaw, because looking at the flaw allows you to ignore your own imperfection.

When the ceremony ends, you stand up. The algorithm releases you. But you are changed. You have been processed by the machine of silence. You step back out into the chaotic noise of the street, carrying the terrifying clarity of a person who, for forty minutes, ceased to exist.
