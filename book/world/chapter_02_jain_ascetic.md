# The Jain Ascetic

This room is made of glass. To walk here is to shatter the silence. You arrive and realize your own footsteps are thunder; you are a giant of noise in a world of absolute fragility.

The inhabitant moves with the deliberation of a bomb disposal unit. He scans the dust exactly four cubits ahead of his toes. This *Irya Samiti* (Regulation of Walking) is necessary because the floor is alive. The *Rajoharana*, a soft broom of white wool, sweeps the path before every step. He saves the world from the violence of his own gravity.

His face is behind a wall. The *Muhpatti* covers the mouth, filtering the hurricane of his breath. The warm air of a human lung is a weapon that could kill the microscopic *nigodas* floating in the wind. He filters his life to minimize the crime of existing.

Karma here is a physical substance, a sticky cosmic dust that clings to the wet cloth of the soul. Anger is glue. Greed is glue. To live is to accumulate weight. The Ascetic practices the hygiene of subtraction. He scrubs the soul clean until it is lighter than air, ready to float to the ceiling of the universe.

As the sun sets, he sits in the *Upashraya*. He abandons food for the night (*Chauvihar*), lest a bug fall into his bowl in the dark. He pulls the sheet over his head, a corpse practicing for death. You stand there, heavy with your leather shoes and your stomach full of life, feeling the terrible weight of your own innocence.
