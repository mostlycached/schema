The Court Jester

This room contains two Kings. One sits on the throne of gold... the other sits on the Marotte... the fool's stick. One wears a crown of iron... the other wears a cap of bells. They are reflections in a warped mirror.

The Jester is the Shadow. The "Licensed Fool" is the only man allowed to tell the truth... provided he tells it as a joke. He moves through the rigid hierarchy like water. He mocks the Bishop... mimics the General... and steals the King's cup.

The court functions as a pressure cooker of sycophancy. Everyone lies to the King. If the King believes the lies... the kingdom falls. The Jester acts as the corrective mechanism... holding up the mirror of satire. "Sire... you are naked." "Sire... you are mortal."

The Jester uses his deformity as armor. Often a dwarf or hunchback... he is "outside" the sexual and political economy... which makes him safe. He is the "Zero" card in the Tarot...the Fool who walks off the cliff.

But the reflection is fragile. If the joke cuts too deep... the license is revoked. The Jester walks the razor's edge between laughter and the dungeon. He looks at the King. The King looks at him. For a moment... they see the truth... the King is just a man with a hat... and the Fool is the only one who knows it. When the Kingdom falls... the statues of the King are toppled... but the Jester simply changes his coat and juggles for the new Emperor.
