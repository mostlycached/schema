The Sommelier

This room lies underground. It is the Cellar. You descend the spiral stairs... leaving the noise of the restaurant behind. The air cools to a constant 55 degrees. You enter the subconscious of the soil.

The Sommelier acts as the librarian of this dark archive. The bottles sleep in racks... covered in dust. Each bottle is a capsule of Time. Bordeaux... 1982. Burgundy... 1999. The Sommelier remembers the story of every year...the frost in April... the heat in August... the rain at harvest.

He believes in Terroir...the conviction that the earth speaks through the fruit. The vine digs deep into the limestone... sucking up the minerals of the Jurassic sea that once covered France. When you drink... you drink ghosts.

He carries the Candle and the Tastevin. He brings a bottle to the light. He checks for sediment...the dregs of time. He decants the liquid... waking it from its twenty-year sleep. He smells the cork... the damp basement... the mushrooms... the grave. He pours. The wine is alive. It is the blood of the earth... purified by the darkness... waiting for the tongue to give it a voice.
