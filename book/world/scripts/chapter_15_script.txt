The Executioner

The Procedure of the State

1.  Anonimity... You cover the face. The Hood hides you from the victim... but mostly from yourself. You are not a man... you are the Hand of the State. You have no name. You are "Monsieur de Paris."

2.  Tool... You sharpen the Axe (or check the rope). The tool must be perfect. Cruelty is a failure of technique. If the blade is dull... it hacks. If the rope is too long... the head tears off. You are a craftsman of the instant ending.

3.  Geometry... You position the body. The neck aligns on the block. You touch the condemned man...the last human contact he will ever experience. You are gentle. "Forgive me..." you say. "I am just the gravity."

4.  Strike... You do not hesitate. The arc of the steel is clean. The separation of the head from the body is a bureaucratic act. Chop. The binary code switches from Alive to Dead.

5.  Aftermath... You pick up the head and show it to the crowd. They cheer... or they gasp. You feel nothing. You wipe the blade. You go home to your wife. You eat your soup. You live on the edge of the city... carrying the sin of the law so the citizens can sleep with clean hands.
