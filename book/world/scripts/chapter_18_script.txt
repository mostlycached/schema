The Perfumer

This room is invisible. It fits inside a vial of glass... no larger than a thumb. It is a Miniature Universe of molecules. To visit this city... you do not use your eyes... you use your nose.

The Perfumer sits at his "Organ..." rows of bottles tiered like a choir. He dips a paper strip (mouillette) and brings it to his face. He closes his eyes. In that single drop... a world expands. He smells the rose fields of Grasse in 1950. He smells the civet cat of Ethiopia. He smells the damp earth of a forest after rain (Geosmin).

This is a Bachelardian compression... the immense contained in the tiny. A perfume acts as a hologram of memory. One molecule of Vanillin triggers the childhood comfort of baking... one molecule of Indole triggers the primal repulsion of decay.

He practices Alchemy to capture the soul of the plant. He mixes the filth (musk... ambergris) with the flower. He creates a "Chord"...Top note... Heart note... Base note. A symphony played on the air.

He corks the bottle. The room is sealed. It sits on a vanity table... a yellow liquid looking like nothing. But uncork it... and the genie escapes... filling the room with desire and ghosts.
