The Coal Mine

This room lies at the bottom of the world. It is the Cellar of civilization. One climbs down to find the sky. The elevator...the "Cage"...drops into the throat of the earth at forty miles per hour. The air grows hot... heavy with the smell of carbon and ancient sweat.

In this cellar... darkness is the default state. The Miner trades his shadow for a cap-lamp. He walks through a forest of fossilized ferns that died three hundred million years before the first eye opened. He travels through the Carboniferous Era.

The "Roof" is a ceiling that wants to fall. The planet presses down with millions of tons of rock. The Miner listens to the "talk"...the groans of the strata shifting. He props up the earth with wooden timbers... Atlas with a pickaxe.

He travels with the Canary. The invisible enemy is Methane (Firedamp)... waiting in the pockets of coal. The bird in the cage is the sensor... if the song stops... you run. The Miner loves the bird for its frailty.

Solidarity here is absolute. There is no race... no religion... only the crew. They are "Battle Brothers" in a war against gravity. When the shift ends... the Cage rises. They burst into the blinding reality of the surface... covered in black dust... blinking like moles... carrying the captured heat of the sun in their pockets.
