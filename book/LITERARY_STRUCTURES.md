# The Invisible Cities Structural Archetypes

This document defines the 15 structural archetypes used to transform the `WORLDS.md` schema into the poetic style of the book. They are divided into three "Canons": Calvino, The Literary Ancestors, and Bachelard.

## I. The Calvino Canon (The Original 8)
*Derived directly from the structures found in "Invisible Cities".*

### Type A: The City (The Panorama)
*   **Frame**: A direct, surreal description of the place. High-angle view.
*   **Key Technique**: Metaphor as Reality.
*   **Examples**: `chapter_01_tuareg` (The Shell/City mix), `chapter_19_watchmaker`.

### Type B: The Object (The Totem)
*   **Frame**: The chapter starts with a physical tool/object in extreme close-up. The city radiates outward from this object.
*   **Key Technique**: Phenomenological Zoom.
*   **Examples**: `chapter_05_gondolier` (The Forcola), `chapter_13_plague_doctor` (The Mask).

### Type C: The Traveler (The Sensation)
*   **Frame**: Second-person ("You arrive..."). Focuses on immediate sensory overload (sound, smell, temperature).
*   **Key Technique**: Immersion.
*   **Examples**: `chapter_02_jain` (Silence), `chapter_06_ama_divers` (The Whistle), `chapter_07_falconer`.

### Type D: The Genealogy (The Spiral)
*   **Frame**: Starts in the deep past (Myth) and spirals to the present/future. Time is the protagonist.
*   **Key Technique**: The Palimpsest (layering time).
*   **Examples**: `chapter_10_scribe` (Clay to Silicon), `chapter_20_glassblower`.

### Type E: The Manual (The Algorithm)
*   **Frame**: Imperative, step-by-step instructions. "First, you must..." A procedure of life and death.
*   **Key Technique**: The Procedure.
*   **Examples**: `chapter_15_executioner`.

### Type F: The Inverse (The Negative Space)
*   **Frame**: The city is defined by what it is *not*, or by what is missing. A city of voids.
*   **Key Technique**: Inversion / Negation.
*   **Examples**: `chapter_03_aghori` (Filth as Divinity), `chapter_11_coal_mine` (Darkness as Light).

### Type G: The Reflection (The Duality)
*   **Frame**: Two cities in one. The Mirror, the Shadow, the Twin.
*   **Key Technique**: The Doppelgänger.
*   **Examples**: `chapter_14_jester` (King/Fool), `chapter_16_bodybuilder` (Man/Image).

### Type H: The Invisible (The Ephemeral)
*   **Frame**: A city made of air, scent, or time. It vanishes as soon as it is built.
*   **Key Technique**: Evanescence.
*   **Examples**: Previously *Tea Ceremony* (now Type J), *Perfumer* (now Type N).

## II. The Dreamy Canon (The Literary Ancestors)
*Structures derived from Borges, Cortázar, Perec, and Kafka.*

### Type I: The Encyclopedia (Borges)
*   **Frame**: Dry, academic precision applied to impossible subjects. Citations of non-existent texts.
*   **Key Technique**: The Fake Footnote.
*   **Examples**: `chapter_10_scribe` (The Library).

### Type J: The Instructions (Cortázar)
*   **Frame**: Playful, absurdist, existential instructions for mundane acts. "Instructions on how to cry."
*   **Key Technique**: The Absurdist Imperative.
*   **Examples**: `chapter_09_tea_ceremony` (Instructions on drinking tea), `chapter_08_bullfighter`.

### Type K: The Inventory (Perec)
*   **Frame**: The obsessional, flat list. Objects listed without adjectives until they vibrate with meaning.
*   **Key Technique**: Exhaustion.
*   **Examples**: `chapter_12_whaling_ship` (Parts of the whale).

### Type L: The Parable (Kafka)
*   **Frame**: A bureaucratic nightmare or an infinite threshold. Waiting for a door that never opens.
*   **Key Technique**: The Loop.
*   **Examples**: `chapter_04_imperial_eunuch` (The Gate).

## III. The Poetics of Space (Bachelard)
*Structures derived from Gaston Bachelard's phenomenology.*

### Type M: The Shell (The Inhabited Space)
*   **Frame**: The house as a body. The psychology of protection and concealment. Inside vs. Outside.
*   **Key Technique**: Enclosure.
*   **Examples**: `chapter_01_tuareg` (The Veil), `chapter_13_plague_doctor` (The Beak).

### Type N: The Miniature (The Universe in a Bead)
*   **Frame**: The immense contained within the tiny. "One must go beyond logic to experience what is large in what is small."
*   **Key Technique**: Compression.
*   **Examples**: `chapter_18_perfumer` (The Drop), `chapter_19_watchmaker` (The Gear).

### Type O: The Cellar (The Subconscious)
*   **Frame**: The verticality of the house. The dark, irrational root.
*   **Key Technique**: Descent.
*   **Examples**: `chapter_11_coal_mine`, `chapter_17_sommelier`.
