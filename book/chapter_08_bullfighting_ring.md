# The Bullfighting Ring

This room is a circle drawn in the sand. Inside the *Ruedo*, death is art; outside, strictly a statistic.

**1. Preparation**: You dress in the "Suit of Lights" (*Traje de Luces*). The heavy gold threads remind you that you are a statue that bleeds.

**2. The Monster**: The gate opens. The Bull enters, a 500-kilogram engine of instinct. He is a question you must answer with your body.

**3. Courage**: You stand still. Your biology screams at you to run, but you disobey. You hold the *Capote* (pink cape) and invite the horn to pass within an inch of your femoral artery. If you move your feet, you are a coward. If you stand like a pillar, you are a god.

**4. Reduction**: You lead the Bull through the three acts of the tragedy. Lances, Banderillas, Death. You sculpt the animal's rage into a shape that fits your sword.

**5. Truth**: You face the tired Bull. This is the *Estocada*. You go in over the horns, uniting man and beast into a single figure. You push the sword into the "Cross."

**6. Result**: The Bull dies instantly, or the horn finds the artery. The sand turns red. The circle remains perfect.
