# The Glassblower

To understand the Glassblower, you must first understand the *Jacks*. They are large steel tweezers, blackened by fire. The Glassblower pays attention to the Heat. He does not touch the glass; he touches the heat. He holds the jacks against the spinning bubble of molten silica. If the glass is too hot, it collapses like honey. If it is too cold, it shatters. He pays attention to the Color. Orange is liquid; red is plastic; dull red is solid. He is working in a window of temperature that lasts for thirty seconds. He is a sculptor of time.

The Glassblower pays attention to the *Pucellas*. These are the "jacks" with wooden blades. They are soaked in water. When he touches them to the glass, steam hisses. The wood does not scratch the glass; it polishes it. He uses them to narrow the neck of a vase, to open the lip of a bowl. He is constantly fighting gravity. The glass wants to drip onto the floor. He must keep the pipe spinning, 60 revolutions per minute, to keep the centrifugal force balanced against the pull of the earth.

This mode of attention is a lineage of breath. The genealogy is one of Murano. In 1291, the Doge of Venice ordered all glass furnaces to be moved to the island of Murano to prevent fires in the city. This created a prison-island of artisans. The glassblowers were forbidden to leave on pain of death. The genealogy is also one of Danger. The *Prince Rupert's Drop* is the totem of this danger. It is a tadpole of glass created by dripping molten glass into cold water. The head is bulletproof; but if you snap the tail, the entire drop explodes into dust. The Glassblower knows that every piece he makes is a potential bomb.

The Glassblower exists in the realm of the *Gather*. This is the act of dipping the blowpipe into the furnace to pick up a blob of molten glass. The furnace is a roaring beast kept at 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit. It never turns off. The Glassblower is a servant of the fire. This creates a unique *Habitus*. The Glassblower is dehydrated. He drinks gallons of water. He has scars on his arms from "kisses" (burns). He moves with a fluid grace. He cannot stop moving. If he stops, the glass droops. He is a dancer partnering with a partner that will kill him if he misses a step.

But worlds, like stars, are subject to decay. The tension in the Glassblower's world is the Energy Cost. Glassblowing is an ecological disaster. The furnaces burn massive amounts of natural gas. The "Decay" is the bill. As energy prices rise, studios are closing. The tension is between the Craft and the Art. The "Studio Glass Movement" tried to move glass from the factory to the gallery. But the market still wants vases. The China is the economic tension. You can buy a hand-blown vase from a factory in China for $20. The Glassblower needs to charge $200 just to cover the gas bill. He cannot compete on price. He must compete on "Soul."

The Glassblower is a Material Scientist. The optimization is Chemistry. He mixes his own "batch" (silica, soda ash, lime). He adds metal oxides for color. Cobalt for blue. Gold for ruby red. He optimizes the "Coefficient of Expansion." If he mixes two glasses with different COEs, they will crack as they cool. The "Jacks" evolve into the Graphite Pad. Graphite is self-lubricating and heat-resistant. The "Annealing" evolves into the Computer Controller. The oven is no longer controlled by a dial; it is controlled by a PID loop.

The Glassblower sits on his bench. The piece is finished. It is a large, complex platter with an *incalmo* lip. He pays attention to the Crack. To be a Glassblower is to be Detached. You break 30% of what you make. He taps the pipe. *Tink*. The platter breaks free. His assistant catches it in a Kevlar glove. They rush it to the annealer. The door slams shut. The Glassblower wipes the sweat from his eyes. He drinks a liter of water. He looks at the empty pipe. He is exhausted, burned, and broke. But he knows that tomorrow, he will open the oven door, and if the gods of silica are kind, he will hold a piece of frozen light in his hands.
