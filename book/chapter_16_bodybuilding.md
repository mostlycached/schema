# The Bodybuilder

To understand the Bodybuilder, you must first understand the *Peak Week*. It is a seven-day ritual of self-mummification. The Bodybuilder pays attention to the Water. For months, he drinks two gallons a day. Then, 48 hours before the show, he stops. He enters a state of controlled dehydration. He wants the skin to be paper-thin, to "shrink-wrap" around the muscle. He sucks on ice cubes to keep his mouth moist. He is a man dying of thirst in a room full of water bottles, all for the sake of a look that lasts ten minutes.

The Bodybuilder pays attention to the Tan. It is not a sun tan; it is a chemical paint. He uses *Dream Tan* (Formula #2, Red Bronze). It is a mix of petroleum jelly, mineral oil, and FD&C Red #40. It is thick, sticky, and gets everywhere. It stains the hotel sheets, the towels, the walls. It smells of coconuts and chemicals. When he applies it, he ceases to be human and becomes a statue cast in bronze. He is no longer naked; he is covered in a layer of performance.

This mode of attention is the endpoint of Greek sculpture. The genealogy is one of Hyper-Reality. The Bodybuilder is not trying to look like a strong man; he is trying to look like an anatomy chart. He is a map of the human body where every territory is exaggerated. The genealogy is also one of Alchemy. The body is the base metal; the mind is the philosopher's stone. Through the pain of the gym, the lead of the flesh is transmuted into the gold of the muscle. The *Glycogen Loading* is a magic trick. By depleting the muscles of carbohydrates for three days and then flooding them with rice cakes, the muscles suck up water like sponges.

The Bodybuilder exists in the realm of the Mandatory Poses. There are eight of them in the IFBB. The Front Double Biceps, the Side Chest, the Rear Lat Spread. These are not random movements; they are a codified language. Every angle is calculated to hide weaknesses and highlight strengths. This creates a unique *Habitus*. The Bodybuilder walks differently. His lats are so wide he cannot put his arms down by his sides. He eats differently. He carries Tupperware containers of chicken and broccoli everywhere. He eats every three hours, not because he is hungry, but because the clock says so.

But worlds, like stars, are subject to decay. The tension in the Bodybuilder's world is the Dysmorphia. The Bodybuilder is never big enough. The "Decay" is the mirror itself. When he looks in the mirror, he sees a skinny kid. He sees the flaws. This is "Bigorexia." The more muscle he builds, the smaller he feels. He is chasing a phantom physique that exists only in his head. The tension is between the Health and the Image. Bodybuilding is ironically unhealthy. The extreme dehydration, the starvation diets, the strain on the heart—it is a sport that destroys the body to perfect the image.

The Bodybuilder is a Bio-Hacker. The optimization is Isolation. The Bodybuilder does not just "lift weights." He isolates specific muscle fibers. He uses the "Mind-Muscle Connection" to fire the medial head of the tricep while relaxing the lateral head. He is a puppeteer of his own anatomy. The "Dream Tan" evolves into the Spray Tan. The messy cream is replaced by a professional airbrush. The "Mandatory Poses" evolve into the Routine. The posing routine is a dance. It is where the sport becomes art.

The Bodybuilder stands backstage. He is pumping up with resistance bands. He is sticky with oil. He is thirsty. He pays attention to the Light. To be a Bodybuilder is to be Visible. You want to be seen. You want to take up space. He hears his number called. He walks out onto the stage. The lights are blindingly bright. The heat is intense. He smiles, but his face is trembling with the effort of holding the pose. He hits the Front Lat Spread. He exhales, squeezing the air out of his lungs to show the striations in his intercostals. He feels the eyes of the judges on him. He is a sculpture that breathes. He is a monster of his own making. And for this one moment, under the lights, he is perfect.
