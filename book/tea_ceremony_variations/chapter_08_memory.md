# The Memory

This room measures exactly four and a half mats. Or it did. You are not certain anymore.

You are eighty-three years old, and you are remembering a tea ceremony that happened when you were nineteen. The host was a woman whose name you have not spoken aloud in decades. The tea bowl was raku ware, black with a single streak of gold. The season was autumn. Or was it spring?

The memory reassembles itself in fragments. The crawl door was lower than you remember—you hit your head entering, and she laughed. Did she laugh? She must have laughed. The woman you remember would have laughed at your clumsiness, gently, with her hand covering her mouth.

The kettle sang. The steam rose. She lifted the ladle, and the water poured in a silver arc that caught the light from the single window. In the memory, the light is impossibly golden. You know this cannot be accurate. Memory lies about color.

She whisked the tea. You watched her wrists. You have never stopped watching those wrists, even now, sixty-four years later, when you cannot remember what you had for breakfast this morning.

The tea was bitter. The tea was perfect. In the memory, the bitterness is vivid, precise, more real than any taste you have experienced since. Your tongue remembers what your mind has forgotten.

She offered the bowl. You took it. Did your fingers touch? They must have touched. You would not have forgotten that.

You drank. You bowed. You left. And then—

The memory ends. It always ends here. You have replayed it ten thousand times, and it always ends with you crossing the threshold of the garden, stepping into a future you can no longer access, leaving behind the only version of yourself that ever understood what it meant to be truly present.

You are eighty-three years old. You are lying in a hospital bed. You are having a tea ceremony in a room that no longer exists, with a woman who died in 1987, and the tea is perfect, and the light is golden, and you are young, and you are happy, and you do not know yet how much you will miss this moment when it is gone.
