# The First-Timer

This room measures exactly four and a half mats. You do not know this. You do not know anything.

You remove your shoes at the entrance. You hope this is correct. You bow before entering. You hope the angle is right. You crawl through the low door, forehead nearly touching the floor, and emerge into a space so still that your own breathing sounds like an intrusion.

The host is already kneeling. You do not know where to sit. You choose a spot and lower yourself, knees protesting against the unfamiliar position. The host does not look at you directly, but you feel observed. Measured.

The ceremony begins. The host reaches for the ladle. You watch intently, trying to memorize each movement. You will need to respond at some point. You do not know when. You do not know how.

The tea is prepared. The bowl is placed before you. You do not know which hand to use. You choose the right. Was that wrong? The host's face reveals nothing.

You lift the bowl. Is there a correct way to hold it? You turn it once, twice—you have seen this in films, but films do not show the angle, the pressure, the exact rotation expected. You drink. The tea is bitter and thick. You suppress a grimace. Is grimacing allowed?

You place the bowl down. You wipe the rim with your fingers. You saw the host do this earlier. You hope you are doing it correctly. You are certain you are not.

The ceremony ends. You bow. The host bows. You crawl back through the low door and emerge into the garden, heart pounding, certain you have committed a dozen unforgivable errors, grateful only that it is over.

Tomorrow, you will remember nothing except the fear. And strangely, the desire to try again.
