# The Scalded Ceremony

This room measures exactly four and a half mats. The water has been heated five degrees beyond the optimal point for matcha. This is not an accident.

The host kneels with perfect posture. The ladle dips into the kettle. Steam rises too aggressively, hissing against the cold air like a warning. The guest watches the host's face for any sign of acknowledgment. There is none.

The tea is poured. The foam is thinner than it should be, the bitterness sharpened to a point. The first sip stings the tongue. The guest swallows without flinching. This is the test.

In this room, harmony is a mask worn over a blade. Every gesture is technically flawless, executed with a precision that borders on violence. The whisk spins faster than necessary. The cloth is folded with too much force.

The guest turns the bowl twice. The host watches. Something has happened between them—a betrayal, a slight, a wound that cannot be spoken aloud. The tea ceremony is the only language left.

When the bowl is empty, the guest bows. The host bows. The water in the kettle continues to hiss. Neither of them has said a word, and yet an entire argument has taken place.

The guest stands, crosses to the crawl door, and leaves. The host remains kneeling, staring at the empty bowl. The steam still rises, five degrees too hot.
