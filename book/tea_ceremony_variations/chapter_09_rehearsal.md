# The Rehearsal

This room measures exactly four and a half mats. It is the seventeenth time today.

The host lifts the ladle. The movement is correct—the angle is correct, the speed is correct, the breath is synchronized—but the teacher watching from the corner shakes her head.

"Again."

The host places the ladle back. The water returns to the kettle. The ceremony rewinds to zero. The guest, a young man whose only job is to receive the tea, sighs and adjusts his knees. He has been kneeling for four hours.

The host begins again. Ladle. Water. Pour. The arc catches the light. The foam rises. The teacher watches with the fixed attention of a predator.

"Stop."

The host freezes. The whisk hovers over the bowl.

"Your wrist rotates three degrees too far. The foam will be uneven. Again."

The ceremony rewinds. The guest does not move. He is a prop, a rehearsal dummy, a body that exists only to receive something that is not yet ready to be given. He thinks about dinner. He thinks about his own hands, which are not trained, which will never make tea that anyone watches this closely.

The host begins again. Ladle. Water. Pour. Whisk.

"Again."

Pour. Whisk.

"Again."

In this room, the sacred moment is mass-produced. The authentic gesture is manufactured through repetition. The ceremony that will one day be witnessed by a real guest—a guest who will believe they are witnessing something spontaneous, something true—that ceremony exists only because of these hours of failure, these hundreds of aborted attempts, this relentless machine of correction.

The tea is poured. The foam is perfect. The teacher nods.

"Once more. Then we break for lunch."

The host closes their eyes. Ladle. Water. Pour. The room smells of matcha and exhaustion. Somewhere, in a future that does not exist yet, a guest will drink this tea and call it harmony.

They will never know.
