# The Silent Ceremony

This room measures exactly four and a half mats. Sound does not exist here.

The walls have been treated with a material that absorbs all vibration. The tatami does not creak. The kettle does not hiss. The whisk does not scrape against the bowl. The guest watches the steam rise from the water, but there is no sound of boiling, no sound of anything at all.

The host moves through the ritual like a figure in a silent film. Their robes shift without rustling. Their feet press into the mats without a whisper. The guest strains to hear their own heartbeat and finds only silence.

In this room, the ceremony becomes a funeral. Each gesture is a prayer offered to no god. The guest feels the weight of their own breathing, the only evidence that they are still alive. But even that seems muted, as if the room is slowly drinking the air from their lungs.

The tea is prepared. The bowl is offered. The guest takes it and drinks. The liquid slides down their throat, but there is no swallow, no gulp, no sound of consumption. The tea simply disappears.

The guest tries to speak. Their lips form the words of gratitude, but the room absorbs them before they can reach the host. The host nods, as if they have heard anyway. Perhaps they have.

When the ceremony ends, the guest crawls through the low door and emerges into the garden. A bird sings. The wind moves through the leaves. The world is suddenly, violently loud. The guest stands there for a long moment, listening to nothing in particular, crying for reasons they cannot explain.
