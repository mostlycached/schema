# The Unseen Servant

This room measures exactly four and a half mats. You will never enter it.

You heated the water before dawn. You swept the garden path three times, erasing your own footprints so that the guest would believe no one had walked there before them. You polished the tea bowl until your reflection disappeared into the glaze.

Now you kneel behind the shoji screen, watching through a crack no wider than a fingernail. The ceremony unfolds in the next room: the host's perfect posture, the guest's reverent silence, the slow dance of ladle and whisk. From here, the sounds are muffled. The harmony is distant, as if heard through water.

The host lifts the bowl. You recognize the movement—you practiced it yourself, once, in an empty room at midnight when no one could see. The host's hands are steady. Yours were not. That is why you are here, behind the screen, invisible.

The guest drinks. The guest bows. The guest admires the scroll, the flower arrangement, the perfect asymmetry of the alcove. The guest does not know that you chose the flower this morning, wading into the river before sunrise to cut the single stem that now stands in the vase.

The ceremony ends. The guest praises the harmony of the room. You hear the word through the paper wall. Harmony. You think of your own hands, raw from scrubbing the floor, invisible beneath the sleeves of your robe.

Later, when everyone has left, you will enter the tea room alone. You will wash the bowl. You will fold the cloth. You will sweep the mats, erasing all evidence that anything happened here at all.

Tomorrow, you will do it again. The guests will never see you. But every ceremony, from the water to the flower to the angle of the light through the window, will carry the shape of your labor.

This is your tea ceremony. This is the only one you will ever have.
