# The Estranged

This room measures exactly four and a half mats. It is too small for the silence between you.

You have not spoken in three years. The letters stopped first, then the phone calls, then even the mutual friends who might have carried messages. And yet here you are, kneeling across from each other, the tea bowl the only thing standing between you.

The host—your once-beloved—lifts the ladle. You remember when those hands held other things: your face, your letters, the small of your back in a crowded room. Now they hold only the instrument of ritual. Now they serve only the tea.

The whisk spins in the bowl. You watch the foam rise and wonder if they are thinking of the same afternoon you are thinking of: the garden, the rain, the argument that ended everything and nothing. You cannot ask. The ceremony does not allow for questions.

The bowl is offered. You reach for it. Your fingers brush theirs for a fraction of a second—an accident, an etiquette violation, a confession. Neither of you acknowledges it. Both of you feel it.

You turn the bowl. Once, to admire the glaze. Twice, to hide your face. You drink. The tea is bitter. The tea is perfect. The tea tastes exactly the way it tasted the first time, when you were young and the future was a road you would walk together.

You place the bowl down. The host retrieves it. Your eyes meet for the first time since you entered. Something passes between you—not forgiveness, not reconciliation, just the simple acknowledgment that you are both still here, still breathing, still bound by something that has no name.

The ceremony ends. You bow. They bow. You leave through the crawl door, emerging into the light of a world that has not changed at all.

You will not see each other again. You both know this. The tea ceremony was the goodbye you never learned how to say.
