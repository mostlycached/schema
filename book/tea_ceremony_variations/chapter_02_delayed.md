# The Delayed Ceremony

This room measures exactly four and a half mats. Time here moves through honey.

The host reaches for the ladle. The motion takes longer than expected. The guest waits. The ladle hovers over the kettle for a moment that stretches, bends, refuses to break.

Water is poured into the bowl. The stream falls slowly, impossibly slowly, as if gravity itself has lost interest. The guest's eyes flick to the host's face. Is something wrong? Have I offended? The host's expression reveals nothing.

The whisk is lifted. It descends toward the bowl. The guest counts the seconds: one, two, three. The whisk has not yet touched the tea. Four. Five. The guest's shoulders tighten. Six.

In this room, silence is not peace. Silence is a question that no one is answering. Each pause feels deliberate, weighted with judgment. The guest replays the last hour in their mind: the greeting, the bow, the way they removed their shoes. Which moment was the mistake?

The tea is offered. The guest reaches for the bowl. The host does not release it immediately. Their fingers hold the rim for one beat too long. Is this a test? A warning? A game?

The guest drinks. The tea is perfect. The temperature is correct. The flavor is balanced. And yet the guest cannot shake the feeling that something terrible is about to happen.

The ceremony ends. Nothing has happened. The guest bows and leaves, carrying with them the strange certainty that they have failed a test they did not know they were taking.
