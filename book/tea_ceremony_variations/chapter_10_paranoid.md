# The Paranoid Ceremony

This room measures exactly four and a half mats. Every mat is a potential message. Every object is a cipher.

You enter through the crawl door and immediately notice: the scroll in the alcove has been changed. Last time it was a poem about autumn. Now it is a single brushstroke, a character you do not recognize. Is this a warning? The host greets you with a bow slightly deeper than protocol requires. What does that mean?

You kneel. The host kneels across from you. Their eyes are calm, too calm. They reach for the ladle, and you watch their hands with the intensity of someone defusing a bomb.

The water is poured. You count the seconds. Six. Seven. Last time it was five. Why the delay? Is the water being heated to a different temperature? You think of the scalding tea you have heard about in stories—the tea served to enemies, punishingly hot, a declaration of war disguised as hospitality.

The bowl is prepared. The foam rises. You study its pattern. Uneven on the left side. Is this intentional? A master of this caliber does not make accidents. Every asymmetry is a choice. You do not know what this choice means.

The bowl is placed before you. You hesitate. The host's face is serene. You turn the bowl once, twice, three times—the correct number—but you pause before drinking. What if it is poisoned? What if the entire ceremony is a trap, an elaborate performance designed to deliver a single fatal sip?

You drink. The tea is bitter. The tea is perfect. You are still alive.

You place the bowl down. The host retrieves it. Their fingers linger on the rim for a moment longer than necessary. You memorize the gesture. Later, you will analyze it. Later, you will dissect every second of this ceremony, searching for the hidden message you are certain was there.

The ceremony ends. You bow. You leave. In the garden, you stop and look back at the tea house. A shadow moves behind the paper window.

You never return.
