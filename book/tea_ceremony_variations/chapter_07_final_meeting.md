# The Final Meeting

This room measures exactly four and a half mats. It will be the last room they ever prepare.

The host's hands tremble slightly as they lift the ladle. The guest pretends not to notice. They have known each other for forty years—student and teacher, then colleagues, then friends, then something beyond friendship that neither of them ever named.

The illness has made the host thinner. The robes hang differently now. The movements are slower, more deliberate, as if each one must be completed before the body forgets how. The guest watches and memorizes: the angle of the wrist, the tilt of the bowl, the way the cloth is folded. These are the last lessons.

The tea is prepared. The foam is perfect. Of course it is—this is the work of a lifetime compressed into a final performance. The host places the bowl down with a steadiness that costs them everything.

The guest lifts the bowl. They turn it once, twice, a third time. Each rotation is a prayer. Each moment is a theft from the future.

They drink. The tea is green and bitter and exactly right. The guest swallows and feels the weight of forty years of mornings just like this one, except that this one will be the last.

The bowl is empty. The guest places it down. The host retrieves it, cleans it, returns it to its place. Every movement is a goodbye. Every gesture says: remember this. Remember me.

The ceremony ends. Neither of them speaks. The guest bows low, forehead touching the mat. This is not the proper depth, but propriety no longer matters. The host bows in return, and when they rise, their eyes are wet.

The guest leaves. The host remains, kneeling in the empty room, listening to the water cool in the kettle.

A month later, the kettle will still be there, cold and silent and waiting for a ceremony that will never come.
