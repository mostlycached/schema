# The Stalled Train

This car measures exactly fifty-one feet. It has not moved in eleven minutes.

The lights flicker. The ventilation hums and then stops. No announcement. The commuters exchange glances—the first eye contact of the morning—and then look away, each pretending they are not afraid.

You feel the tunnel pressing against the walls of the car. Above you, somewhere, the city continues. People are arriving at work. Meetings are starting. Your phone shows no signal. The clock on the wall—if clocks still worked here—would show something approaching intolerable.

A man in a suit begins to pace. Three steps forward, three steps back. The car is too full for more. He stops. He paces again. His tie is loosened. His forehead is wet.

The train lurches forward one inch and then stops. The car exhales. The pacing man laughs. Another eternity.

You think about the meeting you will miss. You think about the explanation you will give. You think about the faces that will not believe you, because stalled trains are the excuse of liars and the truth of the genuinely unlucky—and there is no way to prove which you are.

The lights flicker again. Longer this time. In the darkness, you hear someone praying. You do not know the language. You do not need to.

When the train finally moves—thirteen minutes later, eighteen, you have stopped counting—you feel something like resurrection. The announcement crackles: "We are being held momentarily by the train dispatcher." No explanation. No apology.

You emerge at your stop. The sun is too bright. Your boss is already emailing. You were underground, and the world did not wait.
