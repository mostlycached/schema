# The Driver

This cab measures exactly seven feet. You see the city from behind reinforced glass.

Three hundred souls in the cars behind you. They do not think about you. They think about their phones, their bosses, their children. You think about them constantly.

You announce the stops. Your voice echoes through the cars, processed through the same speaker that has processed a thousand voices before you. The words mean nothing: "Stand clear of the closing doors." You say them because they must be said, not because anyone listens.

The platform approaches. You scan. This is your work: scanning. The edge of the platform, where feet meet yellow line. The gap between car and concrete. The person running, always someone running, arm extended toward doors that should not open but sometimes do.

A child waves at your window. You wave back. The mother does not see. The child will forget. You will remember.

The tunnel is your world now. You know its curves, its shadows, its secrets. You know the station where the homeless man camps every winter. You know the pillar where someone left a shrine—flowers, candles, a photograph of a young woman—that no one else notices anymore. You know the exact spot where, three years ago, you stopped the train.

You do not talk about that spot. You pass through it eight times a day. You will pass through it until you retire.

The dispatch crackles. Delay ahead. Medical emergency. Police activity. You do not ask. You do not need to know. You sit. You wait. You hold the doors closed because opening them is not your decision.

Three hundred souls depend on you. They curse you when you are late. They ignore you when you are on time. You carry them through the dark, and when they emerge into the light, you disappear.

You are the ghost of the train. You are the hand on the dead man's switch. You are the only one who knows the city's real pulse—not the skyscrapers, not the streets, but the tunnels beneath it all, the arteries where the blood of New York really flows.

You call the next stop. No one answers. No one needs to. The machine continues.
