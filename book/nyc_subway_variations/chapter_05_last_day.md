# The Last Day

This car measures exactly fifty-one feet. You have ridden this car one thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven times. Tomorrow you will board a plane.

The graffiti on the window—the tag that says FURY in silver and red—you have studied it for three years. You do not know the artist. You will never know. But you have memorized the curve of the Y, the way the letters lean forward like they are running.

The man in the corner sleeps. He sleeps every morning, 6:47 train, third car from the front. His head falls to the left. It always falls to the left. You will not see him tomorrow. You will not know if he ever wakes up.

The train passes through the tunnel and for a moment the lights flicker off. When they return, the car is different. The commuters are beautiful. The woman reading the tabloid, the teenager with the broken headphones, the businessman staring at his reflection in the dark glass—they are poems you have memorized without knowing, and now you will forget.

Your stop approaches. You do not want to exit. You want to ride the loop forever, downtown to uptown and back again, watching the stations you have ignored become museums, archives, relics of a life you lived for seven years and never once appreciated.

The doors open. You step onto the platform. You look back. The train waits, indifferent. It has swallowed ten million commuters and it will swallow ten million more.

You climb the stairs. The air changes. The light changes. You smell the city—exhaust and pretzels and rain on concrete—and something in your chest collapses.

You thought you hated this commute. You were wrong. You loved it. You loved being nobody. You loved the silence, the density, the routine. You loved belonging to the machine.

You reach the street. You look up at the sky. Tomorrow, none of this will exist.
