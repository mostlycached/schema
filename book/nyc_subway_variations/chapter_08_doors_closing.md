# The Doors Closing

This moment measures exactly three seconds. Everything happens now.

You see the train. You are at the top of the stairs. You should wait. The next train is in four minutes. Four minutes is nothing. But the doors are open, and the doors are closing, and your body is already moving.

You sprint. Your bag swings. Your coffee spills—a sacrifice to the god of transit. You hear the chime. You hear the announcement. "Stand clear." You do not stand clear. You accelerate.

The doors begin to close. You see the gap narrowing. You calculate: two feet, one and a half feet, too late. But you are already committed. Your arm is extended. Your shoulder is turning.

You make it. Your arm does. The doors close on your sleeve. The rubber presses against your bicep. You pull. You are inside.

The train lurches forward. You stumble. Your heart is pounding. Your coffee is gone. Your dignity is on the platform, mixing with the coffee, watched by the commuters who made the rational choice to wait.

But you did not wait. You ran. You made the doors.

It means nothing. You saved four minutes. You will spend those four minutes staring at your phone, just as you would have on the next train. The victory is empty. And yet.

The doors closed and you were inside. The doors closed and the world continued without you, and you were not part of that world—you were here, in the car, moving forward.

This is the micro-drama. This is the daily gamble. Every commuter knows the math: the probability of failure, the cost of the sprint, the humiliation of the bounce-back, the doors reopening and ejecting you because the train needs to move and you are an obstruction.

But today the math worked. Today you made it.

You find a pole. You breathe. Your heart slows. Around you, the commuters stare at their phones, unaware that a miracle has occurred.

You made the doors. You beat time for three seconds. Tomorrow, you will try again.
