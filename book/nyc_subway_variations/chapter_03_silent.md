# The Silent Car

This car measures exactly fifty-one feet. No one is speaking.

There is no mariachi band. No preacher with a megaphone. No argument between lovers, between strangers, between the mad and the indifferent. Only the rhythmic clatter of wheels on track.

You stand in the center of the car and listen to the absence. The man across from you is reading a book. The woman beside him is staring at her phone, but her headphones are not in. The teenager by the door is watching the tunnel through the scratched glass. Everyone is alone together.

The silence is not peaceful. It is a performance. Each person is holding something back—a sneeze, a yawn, a phone call they need to make, a song they want to hum. The silence is a shared agreement to withhold.

You become aware of your own breathing. It is loud. It is too loud. The woman next to you shifts her weight. Did she hear you? Are you breathing wrong?

The train stops. The doors open. Someone coughs on the platform. The sound is deafening.

No one enters. The doors close. The train resumes it rattling prayer through the dark.

You think about all the things you could say. You could comment on the weather. You could ask for directions. You could simply clear your throat and break the spell. But you do not. None of you do.

The silent car moves through the city, carrying its cargo of held words, compressed breaths, swallowed lives. You arrive at your stop. You exit without speaking. You climb the stairs. And only when you reach the street do you realize how badly you wanted someone—anyone—to say good morning.
