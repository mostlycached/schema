# The Sommelier

To understand the Sommelier, you must first understand the *Tastevin*. It is a shallow silver cup, dimpled like a golf ball, worn on a heavy chain around the neck. It is not jewelry; it is a tool of the dungeon. In the days before electric light, the cellar master would use a candle to check the color of the wine. The dimples in the silver were designed to catch and reflect the candlelight through the liquid, revealing clarity and sediment in the dark. The Sommelier pays attention to the Reflection. He is looking for "brightness." A dull wine is a dead wine.

The Sommelier pays attention to the Grid. This is the "Deductive Tasting Grid" of the Court of Master Sommeliers. It is a mental checklist of 30 variables. Sight, Nose, Palate. He does not "drink" wine; he dissects it. He swirls the glass to release the volatile esters. He sniffs. He sips, sucking in air to aerate the liquid in his mouth. He spits. He can tell you the grape, the region, the vintage, and sometimes the specific hillside the grapes grew on, all within 4 minutes and 10 seconds.

This mode of attention is the last vestige of the Royal Taster. The genealogy is one of Paranoia. The original job of the Sommelier was to transport the King's baggage. This evolved into the official who tasted the King's food and wine to check for poison. The Sommelier is a human shield. The silver cup was originally a tool to detect arsenic. The genealogy is also one of Disaster. The wine world is haunted by the ghost of *Phylloxera*. In the late 19th century, a microscopic louse from America destroyed 70% of the vineyards in France. The only solution was to graft European vines onto American rootstocks. The Sommelier knows that the entire industry is a survivor of a near-extinction event.

The Sommelier exists in the realm of *Terroir*. This is the untranslatable French concept that wine tastes like "somewhere." It is the sum of the soil, the climate, the slope, and the soul of the winemaker. This creates a unique *Habitus*. The Sommelier is a geologist. He talks about "Kimmeridgian limestone" and "Galets roulés." He believes he can taste the stones. He licks rocks to understand the difference between slate and granite. He is a sensory extremist. He bans perfume, cologne, and smoking because they interfere with the nose. He lives in a world of pure aroma.

But worlds, like stars, are subject to decay. The tension in the Sommelier's world is the Democratization of Taste. The Sommelier is a gatekeeper. The "Decay" is the app. Vivino and Delectable allow anyone to scan a label and see the rating. The customer no longer needs the priest; they have the data. The tension is between the Natural and the Technical. The "Natural Wine" movement rejects the technical perfection of modern winemaking. They want cloudy, funky wines that taste like cider. The classic Sommelier finds these wines flawed. It is a civil war of aesthetics.

The Sommelier is a Sensory Archivist. The optimization is Vocabulary. The Sommelier invents a language to describe the indescribable. "Cat pee on a gooseberry bush." "Pencil shavings and cigar box." He optimizes the connection between the tongue and the brain. The "Tastevin" evolves into the *Coravin*. This device allows you to pour a glass of wine without pulling the cork. A needle pierces the cork, argon gas is injected, and wine flows out. It allows the Sommelier to sell a glass of 1982 Bordeaux without opening the bottle.

The Sommelier stands in the cellar. It is 55 degrees Fahrenheit and 70% humidity. He pays attention to the Cork. To be a Sommelier is to be Waiting. You are the custodian of time. You are guarding bottles that will not be ready to drink for twenty years. He picks up a bottle of 1945 Mouton Rothschild. He holds the bottle to the light. He sees the sediment, the dregs of history settling at the bottom. He knows that inside that glass cylinder is a living thing, slowly breathing, slowly dying. He puts it back on the rack. He turns off the light. He leaves the wine to sleep in the dark, waiting for the moment when he will wake it up with a corkscrew and a prayer.
