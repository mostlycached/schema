# The Too Long

This morning, you enter the coffee shop at 9:30 AM. Order coffee. Seven dollars. Claim your table. The usual ritual.

The work begins. Time passes.

You look up occasionally. Light changes. Morning becomes afternoon. The population of the coffee shop turns over. People leave. New people arrive.

You stay.

**THE VARIATION**

2:47 PM.

You've been here five hours. Since 9:30 AM.

One seven-dollar coffee.

The barista looks at you. Then looks away. Then looks again.

You feel it: judgment.

**THE PHENOMENOLOGY**

The social contract of the coffee shop is simple: purchase grants access.  But how much access? For how long?

Technically, there's no time limit. No sign that says "maximum 2-hour stay." No enforcement mechanism.

But there's an unspoken rule: the purchase should be proportional to the occupation.

Seven dollars for one hour? Fine. Two hours? Acceptable. Three hours? Pushing it.

Five hours? Abuse.

You know this. You've always known this. But you've never stayed five hours before.

The first hour felt normal. The second hour, productive. The third hour, flow state. The fourth hour—you didn't notice the fourth hour. Time collapsed.

But now, in hour five, you're aware. Hyperaware.

The coffee cup has been empty for hours. Just sitting there, a prop. Evidence of your original purchase, now long consumed.

Should you buy another coffee? You're not thirsty. You don't need more caffeine. But would it buy you legitimacy? Reset the timer?

You look around. Everyone else has fresh drinks. Cups that are full, steam rising. Yours is a corpse.

The table—your table, the one you claimed at 9:30—has become your de facto office. Laptop, books, papers spread out. The La Nacion glass refilled multiple times with free water. You've created a workspace in a space that's not meant to be a workspace.

Or is it? The coffee shop has WiFi, outlets, tables. It's designed for working. But designed for working for how long?

You watch the other customers. They come, they work for ninety minutes, they leave. The turnover is constant.

Except you. You're the constant. The immovable object. The table hog.

A couple enters. Young, dressed up. Clearly a date. They look around for tables. Everything's full. They see you, alone, occupying a four-person table.

They leave.

You feel it: guilt.

You took a table from a couple. A paying couple who would've bought two drinks. The coffee shop lost money because of you.

The barista wipes down the counter. Looks at you again. Do they want you to leave? Should they ask you to leave?

They don't. But the look. The look is enough.

You're making the space worse by staying. You're occupying valuable real estate during prime hours. Your seven-dollar purchase is now subsidizing five hours of electricity, WiFi, water refills, bathroom usage, and spatial occupation.

You're a bad customer. A parasite.

You try to return to work. But you can't. You're too aware now.

Every time someone enters and can't find a table, it's your fault.

Every time the barista passes your table and sees the empty cup, they're judging you.

You could leave. You've done enough work. You could go home, to the office, anywhere else.

But leaving now would feel like admitting you overstayed. Like the barista won.

So you stay. Out of spite. Out of stubbornness.

You pull your phone. Order another coffee. Mobile order, so you don't have to make eye contact with the barista.

"Pick up at counter."

You walk over. The barista hands you the coffee. "Thanks," you say.

They nod. No smile.

You return to your table with the fresh coffee. The evidence of renewed purchase. You've bought another hour, maybe two.

But the coffee tastes like obligation. Like payment for a debt you shouldn't have incurred in the first place.

You drink it slowly. Make it last.

3:15 PM.

Six hours now.

You close the laptop. Enough. You pack up. Books, laptop, the empty La Nacion glass.

The barista watches you leave. You imagine relief on their face. The table hog is finally leaving.

As you walk out, you glance back. Someone has already claimed your table. A woman with a fresh latte. She sits down, spreads out her laptop.

The cycle continues.

**THE INSIGHT**

Third places depend on turnover. The business model requires rotation. Come, consume, leave. Make room for the next person.

When you stay too long, you break the model. You extract more value than you paid for. You become a problem.

There's no explicit rule. No timer. But everyone knows the limit. And when you cross it, you feel it in the looks, the judgment, the guilt.

The coffee shop gave you space. But not infinite space. Not unconditional space.

You're always on borrowed time. And when you borrow too much, you're no longer a customer.

You're a squatter.

The third place tolerates you. But it doesn't want you anymore.

And you can feel the difference.
