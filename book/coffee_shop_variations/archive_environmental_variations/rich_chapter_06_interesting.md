# The Conversation Gets Interesting

This morning, you enter the coffee shop at the usual time. Holiday blend. Three books. The foliage wrapped around the concrete column.

Two women sit in front of you. Late 30s. The one on the left is talking about Michael, Patrick, relationship debris. You've been constructing their sociological profile: women of a type, conversation of a type.

You've decided you're not interested. Your hand moves toward your bag to retrieve the AirPods.

**THE VARIATION**

But then the woman on the left says:

"He told me about the Roden Crater. That thing in Arizona. He said we should go."

You freeze.

**THE PHENOMENOLOGY**

Roden Crater. James Turrell. The volcanic observatory for naked-eye light. The chapter in the Didi-Huberman book sitting on your table right now. The chapter that's been lingering in the background of your mind all morning.

Michael—the ex-boyfriend, the abstraction—apparently recommended they visit Roden Crater.

Your hand moves away from the AirPod case.

The woman on the right says, "What even is that?"

The woman on the left—Lisa, you learned earlier—says, "It's this artist who's been carving out a volcano for like forty years. You walk inside and there are these chambers where you can see the sky change color. Michael was obsessed with it."

"That sounds insane."

"Right? But he said it was a spiritual experience. Like you go down into the earth and then you see light differently when you come back up."

You close Serres. Open Didi-Huberman. The chapter you didn't read today is about this. About the descent into the crater, the chambers calibrated to specific wavelengths, the way Turrell worked with volcanic stone and sky.

Michael, whoever he is, has been reading the same books. Or at least been thinking about the same phenomena.

You want to intervene. To say: *I have a book about this on my table right now.* But you don't. That would be insane. That would be breaking the fourth wall of coffee shop anonymity.

Lisa continues: "He said the sunrise chamber takes years to get into. There's a waiting list. He wanted to sign us up."

"Did you?"

"No. We broke up before... before it would've mattered."

The Roden Crater becomes a signifier of what didn't happen. The trip they never took. The spiritual experience Michael wanted to share. The light they never saw together.

You're reading Didi-Huberman's description: "The walker descends into the cone, passing through tunnels carved from volcanic stone, until arriving at a chamber open to the sky. The sky, framed by the crater's rim, appears as a solid disc of color, changing imperceptibly as the sun moves."

Lisa is describing the same thing, but from the perspective of a relationship that ended before the pilgrimage could happen.

You realize: you're not profiling her anymore. You're listening to her. The sociological type has dissolved into a specific person who almost went to see colored light with a man she loved.

The conversation shifts. They talk about other things—Patrick, sweaters, a weekend trip. But Roden Crater stays in your mind. Lisa said it casually, a throwaway reference. For you, it's the fulcrum of the morning.

You don't put on the AirPods. You keep the conversation ambient, in case she mentions it again.

She doesn't.

At noon, you pack up. The books go back in the bag. Didi-Huberman, finally cracked open to the Roden Crater chapter. Serres and Alexander, unread today.

As you leave, you think: maybe the sociological profiling is a defense. A way to dismiss people before they can surprise you.

Lisa surprised you. Michael surprised you. The conversation you were about to tune out contained exactly what you came here to think about.

**THE INSIGHT**

We decide who's interesting before we've actually listened. We construct profiles, assign types, reach for the AirPods.

But sometimes the conversation contains exactly what we're looking for. Sometimes the woman talking about her ex-boyfriend is also describing the volcanic light chamber you've been thinking about all morning.

The books on the table aren't the only sources of insight. The ambient is a text too. And when you dismiss it as boring, you might be dismissing the very thing you needed to hear.

Stay a little longer before exiting. The Roden Crater reference might be in the next sentence.
