# The Holiday Blend Runs Out

This morning, you enter the coffee shop at the usual time.

You order what you always order: "Just the drip. Holiday blend."

The barista hesitates.

**THE VARIATION**

"Sorry, we're out of the holiday blend. We have the single-origin Ethiopian, or the reserve lot from Colombia."

You look at the board. Ethiopian: $6.50. Colombian reserve: $8.00.

The holiday blend was $4.25.

**THE PHENOMENOLOGY**

This is an economic event.

The cheap option—the bland option with the marketing word attached—has evaporated. What remains is the premium tier. The tier that transforms coffee from commodity to experience.

"I'll take the Ethiopian," you say.

It costs almost fifty percent more. For a drip coffee. For the right to sit here and read Serres.

You take your Ethiopian to the usual table. Spread out the books. Look at the foliage wrapped around the concrete column. Everything is the same except your wallet is lighter.

You sip. It's better than the holiday blend, objectively. There are notes of stone fruit, or citrus, or something the menu promised. You can taste why it costs more.

But you're not enjoying it. You're thinking about the transaction.

$6.50. For a single cup. For maybe ninety minutes of reading time. That's roughly $4.33 per hour to be here. The holiday blend was $2.83 per hour. You're now paying a 53% premium for environmental access.

The women in front of you are talking about Michael. You half-listen. But you're distracted by the mathematics of your presence.

Is the Ethiopian coffee worth the extra money? Or were you paying for the holiday blend's blandness specifically *because* it was cheap? Was the devalued currency of "holiday" part of the appeal—the knowledge that you'd gotten in cheap?

Serres writes about the body. About climbing. About weight and ascent. You think about economic weight. The heaviness of $6.50 versus the lightness of $4.25. You're climbing a steeper price gradient today.

The foliage is still there. The primitive attraction is still there. But something has shifted.

You've always known this coffee shop was a commercial transaction—you pay for the right to be here. But the holiday blend made that transaction feel trivial. $4.25 is nothing. You can forget it as soon as you pay.

$6.50 is not nothing. $6.50 is a decision. $6.50 is a question: is this worth it?

You look around. The other customers are drinking their drinks without apparent concern. Maybe they always order the expensive stuff. Maybe $6.50 is nothing to them. Maybe you're the only one doing the math.

You try to read Will Alexander. "The opal suns within each lens rotate as prisms." But the prisms feel expensive now. Everything feels expensive.

At 11:00, you're barely through a chapter when you notice: the cup is almost empty. You drank the Ethiopian faster than you drink the holiday blend. Because it cost more? Because you wanted to get your money's worth?

You consider ordering another cup. But $13 for two coffees is definitely too much. That breaks the spell entirely.

You pack up earlier than usual. The books go in the bag. The expensive cup, empty.

As you leave, you think: the holiday blend wasn't just bland coffee. It was cheap access. It was the excuse to stay without feeling extracted from.

Without it, the coffee shop feels different. Less like a third place and more like a business. Which it always was. But you didn't have to think about it.

**THE INSIGHT**

The cheap option subsidizes the illusion that coffee shops are public spaces. You pay a small fee, you forget about it, you stay as long as you want.

When the cheap option disappears, the illusion thins. You see the transaction clearly: you're renting a table. You're paying per hour. The books on the table don't change that.

Third places depend on economic accessibility. Not just whether you *can* afford to be there, but whether the cost is low enough to forget.

$4.25: forgettable.

$6.50: memorable.

And memorable costs change how you sit, how long you stay, how deeply you read.

The holiday blend was doing more work than you knew. It was keeping the commercial invisible. Without it, everything is price.
