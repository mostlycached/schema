This morning, you enter the coffee shop at the usual time. Holiday blend, three books, the foliage wrapped around the concrete column like a primitive memory of trees.

Two women sit in front of you. The one on the left has been talking about Michael—someone she broke up with. And Patrick, another man in the narrative. You've been listening without listening, observing without observing, constructing their sociological profile in the back of your mind while Serres tells you about climbing mountains.

The woman on the left is mid-sentence: "—and Michael said he wanted to talk, but I told him—"



The door opens.

A man walks in. Mid-30s. Looking around like he's searching for someone.

The woman on the left freezes. Her face goes pale.

"Oh my god," she says quietly. "That's Michael."



The narrative you were overhearing has just walked into the room.

Michael is real. He has a body, a jacket, a face that looks slightly confused as he scans the coffee shop. He hasn't seen the women yet. But they've seen him.

"Don't look," the woman on the right hisses. But it's too late. The woman on the left is already staring at him. Can't stop staring.

You're watching this unfold. The books on your table—Serres, Alexander, Didi-Huberman—suddenly feel like props from a different movie. You were here to think about the primitive attraction of foliage. Now you're a witness to a soap opera.

Michael sees them. His expression shifts. Recognition. Hesitation. He takes a half-step toward the counter, then stops. Decides. Walks over.

"Hey, Lisa," he says.

So the woman on the left is Lisa. You didn't know her name until now.

"Hey, Michael." Her voice is tight. "What are you doing here?"

"I come here sometimes. I didn't know you—"

He trails off. Because he did know. You can see it on his face. He knew exactly where she'd be on a Tuesday morning because these were once their patterns. Their coffee shop. Their ritual.

Now it's hers, and he's walked into it.

The friend—the woman on the right—is performing intense discomfort. Looking at her phone. Looking at the ceiling. Looking anywhere but at the ex-lover standing three feet from her.

You should look away too. You should read Serres. But you don't. You're watching.

"Can we talk sometime?" Michael asks. "Not here. Just—sometime."

"I don't think that's a good idea," Lisa says.

"Okay. I understand. I just—" He stops. Shakes his head. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come over."

He turns. Walks to the counter. Orders something. Takes it to go.

When he leaves, Lisa exhales. The friend reaches across the table to touch her arm. The conversation resumes, but different now—hushed, urgent, metabolizing what just happened.

You realize you've been holding your breath.

You look at Serres. "Climbing is an ongoing flight from weight," he writes. But you're not climbing. You're sinking into the weight of someone else's breakup, witnessed involuntarily.

The holiday blend is cold. The foliage around the column doesn't feel primitive anymore. It feels like hiding. Like everyone here is hiding from something.



The ambient conversations in coffee shops are narratives in progress. We overhear fragments and fill in the rest.

But sometimes the fragments become concrete. The name you overheard becomes a person who walks through the door. The ex-boyfriend you were profiling becomes flesh and apology.

And then you realize: the abstraction was a comfort. As long as Michael was just a name, you could categorize Lisa as a "type." But Michael appearing makes her a person with a specific history, a specific wound, a specific impossible moment you just witnessed.

You weren't supposed to see that. But you stayed. And now you can't pretend you were just thinking about tree trunks.

The third place is permeable. Stories walk in through the door.
