This morning, you enter the coffee shop at the usual time.

But today the books are different. Instead of Serres' Variations of the Body, you're carrying Deleuze's Difference and Repetition. Instead of Will Alexander's Philosophical Fractal, you have Guattari's Chaosmosis. Instead of Didi-Huberman on Turrell's Roden Crater, you have Deleuze on Bacon's screaming popes.

Same coffee shop. Different intellectual frame.



You order the holiday blend. Claim your table. Look at the foliage wrapped around the concrete column.

And instead of thinking tree trunk—something primitive, like Serres would say, you think:

Deterritorialization. The plant is deterritorializing the column. It's becoming-tree. But the column is also becoming-plant. They're a rhizome.

The woman on the left is talking about Michael again.



Different books, different percepts.

With Serres, you thought about bodies. Climbing. The primitive attraction to shapes that remind us of ancient environments. The coffee shop was a terrarium for the embodied self.

With Deleuze, you think about flows. Multiplicities. Lines of flight. The coffee shop is an assemblage—machines connecting to machines. The espresso machine is connected to the barista is connected to the customer is connected to the economy is connected to the Colombian farmer is connected to—

You're not grounded. You're tracing vectors.

The two women in front of you aren't a "sociological profile" anymore. They're a machine. A friend-machine producing intimacy, reproducing norms, territorializing their bodies into certain shapes (the sweater, the hat) while deterritorializing their emotions (talking about the ex, opening the wound in public).

The woman on the left says "Michael said he wanted to talk, but I told him—"

With Serres, you heard: relational history, bodies approaching and retreating, weight.

With Deleuze, you hear: coding and decoding. Michael is an overcoded signifier she's trying to decode. The friend-machine is helping process the excess. Language is a virus moving between them.

You can't listen the way you listened before. It's not a story anymore. It's a diagram.

You look at the foliage. With Deleuze: not a tree trunk, but a rhizome. No roots, no hierarchy—just spreading. The coffee shop is not a terrarium but a plateau. An "intensive region of continuous variations."

With Serres, you wanted to stay because your body recognized something ancient.

With Deleuze, you want to leave because there are too many connections. Everything links to everything. The coffee is connected to the beans is connected to the roasting is connected to the global supply chain is connected to climate change is connected to—

There's no enclosure. No pocket of calm. Just flows, always flowing.

You try to read Difference and Repetition. "Difference is behind everything, but behind difference there is nothing." Your eyes slide off the page. The concepts fracture but don't cohere.

The woman on the left says something about Patrick. With Serres, you would've tracked the developing narrative. With Deleuze, Patrick is just another point in a network, another node in the relational diagram.

You put on your AirPods. Agnes Obel. But even the music is different now. It's not a retreat—it's a line of flight, a deterritorialization, a temporary smooth space inside the striated coffee shop assemblage.

You're not calmer. You're just differently agitated.

At 11:30, you pack up. The books go back in the bag. Difference and Repetition, barely opened. Chaosmosis, untouched. Francis Bacon, same.

You realize: you brought the wrong toolkit. The coffee shop isn't a plateau. It isn't a rhizome. It's a room with plants and people and coffee. And you wanted to think about bodies, not machines.

Tomorrow you'll bring Serres back. The primitive is better than the virtual here.



The books we carry are lenses. They don't describe what we see—they produce what we see.

Serres gives you bodies, weight, ancient attractions.

Deleuze gives you flows, assemblages, diagrams.

The coffee shop stays the same. But the experience is entirely different depending on what you're reading.

Choose your lens carefully. Some make you want to stay. Some make you want to trace lines of flight out the door.

The primitive outperformed the rhizomatic here. Not universally—just in this particular terrarium. Just on this particular Tuesday.

Tomorrow's books will produce tomorrow's coffee shop.
