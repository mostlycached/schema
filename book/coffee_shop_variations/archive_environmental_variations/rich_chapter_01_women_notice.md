# The Women Notice You

This morning, you enter the coffee shop at the usual time. Holiday blend ordered—drip coffee, the bland option marketed with a word that means less every time it's used. Three books spread on your table: Serres' *Variations of the Body*, Will Alexander's *Philosophical Fractal*, Didi-Huberman's *The Man Who Walked in Color*. You've read from Serres and Alexander today. Didi-Huberman's chapter on Roden Crater lingers in background.

You look at the foliage wrapped around the concrete column. Maybe it reminds you of a tree trunk—something primitive, Serres would say. Something Will Alexander might fracture into shards of language.

Two women sit in front of you. Late 30s, you estimate. Similar build, similar conversation rhythm. The one on the left has been talking about Michael, someone she broke up with, and Patrick—another relationship, unclear status. They're bonding over relationships and sweaters.

You've been constructing their sociological profile without them knowing. Women of a type, conversation of a type, ritual of a type.

**THE VARIATION**

The woman on the left stops mid-sentence.

She's looking at you.

Not glancing. Looking. She caught you watching.

"Sorry," she says, with an edge. "Is something interesting over here?"

**THE PHENOMENOLOGY**

Your face goes hot.

You've been caught doing something you didn't think was visible: observing. Constructing. Profiling.

"Sorry, no—just spaced out," you say. Weak. It sounds like a lie because it is a lie. You weren't spaced out. You were actively categorizing them.

The woman holds your gaze for another second. Her friend turns to look at you too. Two pairs of eyes now. The sociological subject has become the subject who observes back.

You look down at Serres. The words blur. You're not reading. You're waiting for them to return to their conversation.

But they don't immediately. There's a murmur between them. You catch fragments: "...was staring..." "...creepy..." You can't hear clearly but you can imagine.

The primitive attraction to the foliage suddenly feels absurd. You were thinking about tree trunks while being caught profiling women. The intellectual frame that felt so rich—Serres on the body, Alexander fracturing language—now feels like cover for something less noble.

What were you actually doing?

You were looking at them. Noticing that one was "moderately attractive but heavier around the torso." Wondering about their sociological profile. You told yourself it was observation. But from where they sat, it was staring. From where they sat, you were the creep at the other table.

The coffee shop feels smaller now. The plants don't create private pockets—they create hiding spots for people who watch.

You should leave. That would be conspicuous. You should stay. That would be uncomfortable.

You stay. You pretend to read. But you're acutely aware of their awareness of you. Every time you shift, you wonder if they're tracking you. The power has inverted—they're observing you now.

The holiday blend goes cold. You don't sip it. Movement feels dangerous.

Eventually they leave. Relief. But also: shame. Not for looking at them—you do that everywhere, all the time—but for getting caught. For having the gaze reflected back.

You think about Didi-Huberman's Roden Crater: a walk through colored light. But this wasn't light. This was the structure of looking being exposed. You thought you were invisible. You weren't.

**THE INSIGHT**

We observe people constantly. It feels like thinking—constructing types, noticing details, filing observations under sociological labels.

But from the other side, it's being watched. It's someone staring at you while you talk about your ex-boyfriend.

The coffee shop gives us permission to observe because we're "anonymous." But anonymity is a fiction. When the subject looks back, the observer becomes the observed. And there's no intellectual frame that makes that comfortable.

Serres can't save you. Alexander can't fracture your way out of this. Didi-Huberman's colored light has no color.

You were caught. And now you know what your gaze feels like from the other side.
