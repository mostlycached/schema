# The Foliage Is Gone

This morning, you enter the coffee shop at the usual time.

Something is wrong.

The foliage—the massive plants that wrapped around the concrete columns, creating intimate pockets throughout the space—is gone.

---

**THE VARIATION**

The columns are bare concrete. Industrial. Grey.

Where the fiddle-leaf figs used to stand, there are now empty corners. Where the plants used to filter light into green-gold patterns, there's just fluorescent overhead glare.

A sign near the counter: "PLANT MAINTENANCE - Temporary removal. They'll be back soon!"

**THE PHENOMENOLOGY**

You order your holiday blend. Claim your usual table. Spread out the three books: Serres, Alexander, Didi-Huberman.

But you can't settle.

The concrete column in front of you is just a column now. No foliage wrapped around it. No reminder of tree trunks. No primitive attraction.

You thought you came here to read. To observe. To think. But apparently you came here for the plants.

Without them, the space feels like a cafeteria. Or a waiting room. The architectural bones of the coffee shop are exposed, and they're not beautiful. The yellow tiles still exist, but without the green canopy above, they look cheap. Garish.

You try to read Serres. "Climbing is an ongoing flight from weight," he writes. But you can't focus. Your eyes keep drifting to the bare column. To the empty corners where green things used to live.

The two women from before aren't here today—different configuration—but even if they were, you wouldn't be listening to their conversation. You're too distracted by what's missing.

Why does this matter so much?

You thought the attraction to this place was intellectual: the third place, the coffee ritual, the productive ambient noise. But apparently it was visual. Botanical. Primitive.

Without the plants, you don't want to be here.

You think about what Serres would say. The body remembers environments that match some ancient comfort. Trees, shade, filtered light, enclosed green spaces. The coffee shop was simulating something your nervous system recognized from deep time.

And now that simulation is stripped away. Now it's just a room with concrete columns and overhead lights. Now it's commerce without the foliage alibi.

You try to write. Nothing comes. You try to observe. Nothing interesting. You try to feel the space. It feels wrong.

The holiday blend tastes the same, but you're drinking it faster. Not savoring. Just consuming before you can leave.

You realize: you don't love this coffee shop. You loved the plants. They were doing ninety percent of the work.

At 11:15, you pack up. Earlier than usual. The books go back in the bag. Serres' chapter on climbing, half-finished. Alexander's poem, skimmed but not absorbed. Didi-Huberman, untouched.

As you leave, you glance back at the bare concrete column. Without its green wrapping, it's just infrastructure. Just the skeleton the foliage was hiding.

Maybe they'll be back soon. The sign promised. But you're not sure you'll be back soon. You're already thinking about other coffee shops. Other places with plants, with filtered light, with that primitive something Serres hinted at.

**THE INSIGHT**

We think we choose spaces for complex reasons: the coffee, the vibe, the convenience. But often the reason is simpler and deeper.

The foliage wasn't decoration. It was the reason. It triggered something ancient in your body that said *this is a good place to sit*. Without it, the rest falls apart.

Third places are ecological. They depend on specific elements—light, green, texture, warmth—that we don't consciously track but absolutely require.

Remove one element and the spell breaks. The coffee shop becomes what it always was underneath: a commercial space with concrete columns and fluorescent lights.

The primitive was doing the work. When it's gone, so are you.
