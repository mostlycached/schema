You read one specific poem. "The Blood of the Vibrations."

You don't understand it. Not rationally.

But you feel it.



The poem is a rhythm. A drumbeat.

Tum-ta-tum-ta-TUM.

You find your foot tapping.

The coffee shop has a rhythm too. The clink of cups. The hiss of steam. The murmur of voices.

Usually, these rhythms are chaotic.

But the poem organizes them.

You are conducting the coffee shop with the poem.

You read a line: "The scarlet geometry of the soul."

The espresso machine hisses on the word "scarlet."

The bell rings on the word "geometry."

The woman laughs on the word "soul."

Synchronicity.

Alexander believes in this. That language can magnetize reality. That if you speak the right words, the world aligns with them.

You try it.

You look at the foliage. You think: "Green vertex of silence."

A leaf moves. (Air current? Or response?)

You look at the holiday blend. You think: "Bitter elixir of the wakeful."

You take a sip. It tastes more bitter. More awake.

You are not reading a text. You are operating a console.

The book is a piece of technology for altering the experienced reality.

By feeding these high-intensity words into your brain, you are changing the processing parameters of your cortex.

You are overclocking your perception.

Everything is sharper. Louder. More significant.

The two women are not just chatting. They are performing an ancient ritual of unburdening.

The barista is not just making coffee. He is an alchemist transforming matter.

You feel a surge of energy. This is what poetry is for.

Not to be pretty.

But to wake you up.

You are awake.

Wide awake.

Vibrating.
