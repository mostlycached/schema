You have climbed with Serres.

You have fractured with Alexander.

You have descended with Didi-Huberman.

Now, you put all three books on the table.

The Trinity.



You look at the scene one last time.



Serres: It is a climber. A vertical vector against gravity.

Alexander: It is a "chlorophyll antenna," a "green specter in the concrete void."

Didi-Huberman: It is an aperture. A filter that modulates the light-volume of the room.

It is all three.

It is a climbing, spectral, light-modulating entity.



Serres: They are thermodynamic knots. Circulations of energy and language.

Alexander: They are "relational shards," "echoes in the void."

Didi-Huberman: They are surfaces touched by the Amber and Green light.



You have to leave.

The coffee is done. The ritual is complete.

But how do you leave?

Do you descend (Serres) from the mountain of the café?

Do you shatter (Alexander) the scene and walk out through the shards?

Do you ascend (Didi-Huberman) out of the crater?

You choose all three.

You stand up. (The Ascent).

You pack the books. (The Condensation of the Fractal).

You walk to the door. (The Traverse).

You push the door open.

The cold air hits you.

The noise of the street.

The light of the sun.

You have been reading.

And because you have been reading, you have been everywhere.

On a mountain. In a prism. In a volcano.

You step onto the sidewalk.

You are just a person again.

But you are carrying the mountain, the prism, and the volcano in your bag.

You walk away.

The city is waiting to be read.
