You have not read the chapter on Roden Crater yet. But Didi-Huberman is about "The Man Who Walked in Color." James Turrell.

You decide to perform the walk here.

The coffee shop is 40 feet long.

You stand up. You leave your books. You leave your coffee.

You walk to the bathroom and back.



You treat the air as a solid medium.

Didi-Huberman writes about "color as a substance." Not a surface property, but a volume you move through.

You enter the zone of the window. The light is white-blue (Winter Morning).

You feel it on your skin. You breathe it in. You are wading through a blue medium.

You pass the counter. The light is yellow-orange (Incandescent + Coffee Warmth).

The temperature changes. The medium thickens.

You are walking through amber.

You pass the foliage. The light is filtered green (Chlorophyll Shadow).

It feels cooler. Subaqueous.

You are walking through a pond.

You return to your table.

You sit down.

You have traveled through three distinct chromatic zones.

Blue. Amber. Green.

Most people just walked to the bathroom.

You performed a phenomenological experiment.

You look at the woman on the left.

She is sitting in the intersection of the Amber and the Green.

Her face is a canvas where these two volumes collide.

One side of her face is warm. The other is cool.

She is a bi-chrome entity.

Didi-Huberman asks: "What is the color of an experience?"

The color of her grief about Michael is... what?

Grey? Violet?

No. It is the color of the room she is in.

Her grief is Amber-Green.

Because that is the light that is touching it right now.

If she were grieving outside, in the Blue, it would be a different grief.

The space creates the feeling. The light constructs the emotion.

You realize: You cannot separate the thought from the tint.

Your thoughts about Serres were Blue (clear, high).

Your thoughts about Alexander were Prismatic (shattered).

Your thoughts about the women are Amber (warm, heavy).

You are not thinking in a void. You are thinking in a colored volume.
