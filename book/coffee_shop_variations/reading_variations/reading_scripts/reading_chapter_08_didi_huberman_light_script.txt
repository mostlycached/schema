You sit still. You stop reading. You apply the Roden Crater method.

"The apprehension of light as a thing in itself."



You stare at the white wall opposite you.

Usually, you look at the wall. You see the paint, the texture, the scuff marks.

Turrell asks you to look at the light in front of the wall.

You soften your gaze. You de-focus.

You try to see the air between you and the wall.

It is vibrating.

Dust motes? Maybe.

But also: photons.

The space is full. It is not empty space between objects. It is a plenum of radiation.

You are sitting in a soup of light.

It presses against your eyes. It presses against your skin.

The foliage is not a "thing." It is a hole in the light. A place where the light is absorbed.

The shadow behind the column is not darkness. It is just less light. A thinner soup.

You lose the sense of distance.

When you see objects, you know how far away they are.

When you see light, distance collapses.

The blue of the window is right here, on your retina.

The yellow of the tile is right here.

You feel a sudden intimacy with the room.

You are touching everything with your eyes.

Or rather: everything is touching you.

The woman's sweater (Red) is throwing red photons at you. She is physically touching your eyes with her redness.

"Michael," she says.

Sound waves touching your ears.

Red light touching your eyes.

Coffee vapor touching your nose.

You are being touched by the world in every modality.

Didi-Huberman calls this "the tactile eye."

The eye that touches. The eye that is touched.

You feel vulnerable. You are transparent.

The world is flooding in.

You close your eyes.

But the light is still there. Orange-red through the eyelids.

You cannot escape the medium.

You are the medium.
