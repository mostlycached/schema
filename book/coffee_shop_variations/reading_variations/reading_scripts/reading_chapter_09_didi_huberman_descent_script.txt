Roden Crater is a volcano. To see the sky, you have to go down into the earth.

The paradox: deep descent produces high vision.

You treat the book as the crater.

You open Didi-Huberman.

THE HOLE IN THE TABLE

The page is white. But the text is a hole.

You fall into it.

You read about the "pathos of distance." About the "survival of the image."

You are going down.

Down into history. Down into art theory. Down into the deep time of the image.

The coffee shop around you disappears.

This is the "tunnel vision" of reading.

But Didi-Huberman constructs it as a physical space.

You are in the catacombs of the concept.

It is dark here. The "holiday blend" is gone. The "foliage" is gone.

There is only the text. The glowing white rectangle of the page.

And then: the looking up.

You finish the paragraph. You look up.

You are at the bottom of the crater looking up at the sky.

The ceiling of the coffee shop.

You see it with "crater eyes."

It is framed by the edges of your concentration.

It looks incredibly distant. Incredibly framed.

For a second, the coffee shop is not a mundane room.

It is a "skyspace." A frame for the passing of time.

You see the shadow of the fan blade cross the ceiling.

Time passing.

The shadow of a cloud outside dims the room.

Planetary motion.

You are in the volcano. The coffee shop is the observatory.

You needed to go deep into the book to see the ceiling as the sky.

The woman laughs.

It echoes. Like a sound in a crater.

It sounds lonely. It sounds small against the vastness of the sky-ceiling.

You return to the book. You descend again.

You are diving for pearls. You dive, you grab the concept, you surface.

Dive. Surface. Dive. Surface.

Each time you surface, the world looks different.

Wetter. Brighter. Stranger.

This is the rhythm of the scholar.

The diver.
