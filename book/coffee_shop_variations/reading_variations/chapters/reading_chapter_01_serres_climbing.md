# Serres: Climbing

The coffee shop is not a room. It is a verticality.

You open Michel Serres, *Variations of the Body*. Chapter One. "The body climbs."

You are sitting in a bentwood chair, holiday blend at your elbow, but Serres does not allow you to sit. He demands that the body be understood in ascent. "Climbing is an ongoing flight from weight," he writes.

You read. And as you read, the text begins to overwrite the proprioception of the café.

**THE ASCENT**

The sentence is a foothold. You place your attention on it. You pull yourself up.

*The body is not a statue.* You feel the micro-adjustments in your spine as you lean over the book. Your neck muscles tense—not from strain, but from the exertion of holding the concept.

Serres describes the mountaineer. The precise placement of the boot. The hand finding purchase on the rock face.

You look at your hand holding the coffee cup. It is not resting. It is gripping. The cup is a hold. The table is a ledge. The coffee shop floor is the valley you have left behind, even though your feet touch it.

You are not reading about climbing. You are climbing the book.

The text resists. Serres is not easy. His sentences are crags. You have to find the fissure in the syntax, wedge your understanding in, and hoist yourself to the next clause. "The body works against the fall."

You feel the vertigo of the idea. If you stop paying attention, you fall back into the mundane. You fall back into the "holiday blend," the "two women talking," the "foliage." That is the gravity.

Reading is the anti-gravity.

The woman on the left laughs. A falling sound. Loose rocks tumbling down the slope. You acknowledge it but do not look down. You are higher now. You are on page 14.

The air is thinner here. The ambient noise of the café sounds distant, muffled by altitude. You are in the zone of the high pass. The light from the window is not coffee shop light; it is the harsh, clear light of the summit.

You sweat. Not physically, but cognitively. The effort of sustaining the Serresian worldview—where the body is always a transformation, always a knot of energies—requires calories. The coffee provides the fuel for the ascent.

You pause. Look up.

The foliage on the column. Serres would say: the tree is a climber too. It defies gravity. It pumps water uphill. You are kin to the plant. You are both vertical systems struggling against the flatteners of the world.

You look at the women. They are resting on the plateau of conversation. Easy ground. Flat ground.

You envy them for a second. Then you look back at the page. The next foothold awaits.

"To climb is to be reborn."

You grip the table. You lean in. You push off from the paragraph and rise.

**THE INSIGHT**

We think reading is a sedentary act. We think we are "sitting and reading."

Serres exposes the lie. Reading is a motor activity. It is a struggle against the entropy of the mind, which wants to slide back into the easy, the known, the ambient.

To read philosophy is to train for altitude.

When you close the book, you will feel the descent. The coffee shop will rush back in—heavy, loud, horizontal. You will feel the weight return.

But for now, you are climbing. Don't look down.
