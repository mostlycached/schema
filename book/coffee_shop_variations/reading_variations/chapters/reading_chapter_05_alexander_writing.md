# Alexander: Writing as Alexander Writes

You put the book down. But the virus is effective. You cannot stop it.
You pick up your pen. You try to capture the scene.
But you cannot write "The woman drank her coffee."
That sentence is dead. It is inert. It fails to capture the "magical realism" of the actual moment.

You write:

---

**THE JOURNAL ENTRY**

*In this zone of botanical suspension, where the massive green fronds interrupt the concrete verticality, two entities commune.*

*The entity on the left—a vessel of retrospective grief—emits sonic vibrations concerning the absence of the Michael-figure.*
*Her discourse is a spiral. A recursive loop of memory and rejection.*
*She wears a garment of woven wool, a chaotic texture against the smooth skin of her throat.*

*The dark liquid in my chalice cools. Entropy is the only true clock in this room.*

*I observe them through the lens of the socius, but the lens is cracked. I see not types, but singularities. Each gesture a unique trajectory in the space-time of the morning.*

*The foliage witnesses us. It is the silent judge. The ancient biological observer.*

*I am not a customer. I am a consciousness suspended in a network of exchanges—monetary, linguistic, caloric.*

**THE AFTERMATH**

You stop writing. You look at what you have done.
It is ridiculous.
And yet.

It captures something the "plain style" misses.
It captures the *strangeness* of being here. The weirdness of two mammals sitting in a room drinking hot bean water and making noises at each other about a third mammal who isn't there.

Standard English makes this normal. "Two women talking about an ex."
Alexander's English makes it alien. "Entities communing in the zone of suspension."

Which one is true?
The normal feels true because it is familiar.
The alien feels true because it is raw.

You look at the woman again. She wipes her eye.
"Lachrymal discharge," you think.
Then: "No. She's crying."

The Alexander lens breaks. The raw human fact punches through the cosmic language.
She's just crying.

But for a moment, you saw her as a star. A suffering star.
And that gave her dignity.
