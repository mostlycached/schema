This morning, you enter the coffee shop at the usual time. Yellow tiles catch the light. Fiddle-leaf figs tower overhead. The ambient soundtrack: lo-fi hip hop, as always. Mellow beat, vinyl crackle, jazz samples. The audio wallpaper of every trendy coffee shop in urban America.

You claim your table. Laptop, books, water glass. Headphones in your bag—you won't need them. The music here is perfect. Ambient enough to fade into background. Rhythmic enough to create flow.

You settle in. The beat becomes your heartbeat. You work to its tempo.



11:23 AM. Mid-sentence, the music cuts out.

Brief silence.

Then: loud electronic dance music. EDM. Aggressive synths. 128 BPM. Drop. Bass. Completely different vibe.

You look up, disoriented. Others do too. Confused glances around the room.

The barista, behind the counter, is bopping to the new music. Smiling. They changed it. On purpose.



The coffee shop is the same physical room. Same yellow tiles. Same plants. Same light. But it feels like a completely different space.

The lo-fi created a calm, contemplative atmosphere. Productivity-core. Study vibes. The music said: "You're a thoughtful person doing important work in a beautiful room."

The EDM says: "You're at a day party. Why aren't you dancing?"

You try to keep working. But the beat is too aggressive. Too present. It demands attention. You can't fade it into background because it refuses to be background.

Around you, people are reacting differently.

Some leave immediately. One person packs up mid-coffee, clearly done. The soundscape violated the social contract.

Others put on headphones. Creating their own audio bubble. Retreating from the shared sonic space.

A few seem fine with it. One person is actually nodding along. Maybe they like EDM. Maybe this is their vibe.

But for you—and for most people here—the music changed the room.

You try headphones. Pull them out, connect, open Spotify. Search for... what? Lo-fi hip hop. The same vibe the coffee shop just killed.

You're now listening to lo-fi hip hop on your headphones to recreate the experience you came here for. Which the coffee shop used to provide. But doesn't anymore.

This is absurd.

You take the headphones off. Try to work with the EDM. Maybe you'll adjust. Maybe it's fine.

Ten minutes. You write maybe three sentences. The beat keeps interrupting your thought. The drop happens. You lose your train of thinking entirely.

You check the time: 11:47 AM. How long will this music last? Is this permanent? Did the barista just... decide the entire coffee shop vibe on their own?

Yes. They did. Because they control the playlist. And you have no say.

This is the realization: you don't control the environment. You thought you did. You chose this coffee shop. You chose this table. You chose your coffee.

But the soundscape? That's theirs. The barista's. The owner's. Whoever has access to the Bluetooth speaker.

And soundscape isn't decorative. It's fundamental. Sound shapes how you feel, how you think, how you work.

The coffee shop you entered at 9:30 AM is gone. This is a different room now. Same walls, different world.

You glance at the barista. They're vibing. Genuinely enjoying the music. Does it not occur to them that everyone else is struggling?

Or maybe—darker thought—maybe they don't care. Maybe they're bored of lo-fi after eight-hour shifts. Maybe this is their rebellion. Their way of claiming the space back.

You're just the customer. You paid $7. That doesn't buy you control. It buys you a seat and WiFi. The vibe is not guaranteed.

Should you say something? "Hey, could you change the music back?"

But that's awkward. Entitled. Karen-ish. You don't want to be that person.

So you sit in the loud music, not working, resenting the situation but unable to do anything about it.

12:03 PM. Someone else—braver than you—walks up to the counter. "Hey, I hate to ask, but the music is pretty loud. Could you maybe turn it down or switch it back?"

The barista looks surprised. "Oh! Yeah, sure. No problem." They change it back to lo-fi.

Immediate relief. The room transforms again. Calm returns. People visibly relax.

You're grateful to the brave person. But also: it shouldn't have required bravery. The music shouldn't be a problem in the first place.



Coffee shops are constructed environments. Every element—music, lighting, temperature, smell—is designed to create a vibe.

We think we choose coffee shops for the coffee. We don't. We choose for the atmosphere. And atmosphere is fragile. One variable changes, and the entire experience collapses.

The music isn't yours to control. The barista controls it. And when they change it, they change the room.

You can adapt (headphones), exit (leave), or petition (ask them to change it). But you can't control it. And that's the limit of your power in this third place.

You're a guest in a constructed world. And the world can change without your consent.
