This morning, you enter the coffee shop at 9:30 AM. The yellow tiles reflect morning light. You claim your table beneath the fiddle-leaf f

igs, spread out the books and laptop. The La Nacion glass gets filled with water. The ritual is complete.

You check the time before you start: 9:42 AM. The whole morning ahead. No meetings until 2 PM. Perfect.

You open the document you've been working on. Take a sip of coffee. Begin.



You look up.

The light has changed. It's not morning light anymore. It's afternoon light—lower, warmer, coming from a different angle entirely.

You check your phone: 1:47 PM.

Four hours.

Four hours have passed. You thought it had been maybe 45 minutes. An hour at most.

But no: 9:42 AM to 1:47 PM. Time collapsed. Where did it go?



You scan the coffee shop, disoriented. The two women who were there this morning—gone. Replaced by different people. The older man at the counter—also gone. A younger couple sits there now.

The fiddle-leaf figs are the same. The yellow tiles the same. But the population of the room has turned over. You're the constant. Everyone else left and was replaced, and you didn't notice.

You look at your laptop. The document is filled with words. Thousands of them. You wrote all that? You must have. The timestamp says so. But you don't remember writing it. You were in it –full flow state—and the hours evaporated.

Your coffee cup: empty. How long has it been empty? You don't remember finishing it.

The La Nacion glass: also empty. When did you drink all that water?

Your back hurts. You've been in this bentwood chair for four hours without moving. Your posture is locked.

You stand up—legs stiff. Walk to the bathroom just to move, to re-enter your body. In the mirror: your face looks tired. The beanie has left a line on your forehead. Four hours of pressure.

When did you last check your phone? You unlock it. 23 unread messages. 6 Slack notifications. The world continued without you, and you were gone, inside the work.

Is this good? Bad?

On one hand: this is the fantasy, right? Flow state. The thing you came to the coffee shop for. Total immersion. Time collapse. The work swallowing you whole.

On the other hand: you lost four hours. Not "spent"—lost. You can't account for them. They happened to you, not by you.

You sit back down. Look at the document. It's good work. Genuinely good. But the cost was dissociation. You left your body, left the room, left time itself.

The meeting is in 13 minutes. You were supposed to be working on notes for the meeting. But you worked on this other thing instead. Now you're unprepared.

You try to remember: did you eat? No. It's almost 2 PM. You've had coffee and water. That's it. You feel it now—the hunger, the lightheadedness.

The coffee shop looks different in afternoon light. The botanical shadows fall differently. The vibe is different too—more crowded now, louder.

You pack up quickly. Four hours here means four hours of rent you're not paying. But also: four hours of output. The coffee shop gave you something. It took something too.

Outside, the street is bright. Blinding. You've been in dim botanical interior for so long that full daylight is shocking.

You check your phone again: 1:53 PM. Seven minutes until the meeting. You'll be late.

You walk fast, but part of you is still back there, in the collapsed time, in the document, in the flow.



The coffee shop is a time-distortion device. The ritual, the ambient sound, the plants, the other people working—it all creates conditions for flow, for hours to vanish.

This is its magic. But also its danger.

We go there to work. But we lose track of ourselves. Time collapses, and we become pure productivity machines. When we emerge, disoriented, the day is half gone.

Is that what we wanted? Maybe. But we didn't realize the cost: dissociation, hunger, stiffness, the world moving on without us.

The third place promised focus. It delivered. But focus taken too far becomes disappearance.
