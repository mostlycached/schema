This morning, you enter the coffee shop at the usual time. Yellow tiles underfoot, geometric and bright. You claim your table—the one with good light—and spread out: laptop, books, the La Nacion glass for water, white mouse beside the trackpad.

The barista nods. You nod back. Seven dollars exchanged for unlimited time and megabytes. The coffee arrives. You sip. You open the laptop. The work begins.

The coffee shop hums with its familiar soundtrack: espresso machine hissing, murmured conversations, the playlist (lo-fi hip hop, always), and beneath it all, the ambient knowledge that you're connected. To the internet. To the possibility of productivity.

11:42 AM. Mid-keystroke, the page stops loading.

You refresh. Nothing. Still connected, but the little exclamation mark: "No Internet Access."

You look around. Others are looking up too. The two women at the adjacent table exchange glances. The ambient connectivity everyone was swimming in has silently drained away.

The barista notices the collective unease. "Yeah, sorry! Internet's down. They're working on it."

How long? They don't know.

The coffee shop doesn't look different. But the feel has transformed entirely.

Without WiFi, your laptop is suddenly just a very expensive typewriter. Email won't send. Slack is frozen. You could work offline, theoretically, but your entire workflow assumes connectivity.

You look at the blank screen. What can you actually do without internet? Write? Maybe. But you'd need to look something up. Every thought leads to a Google search you can't perform.

Around you, others are making decisions. Some pack up immediately. They leave, seeking another coffee shop, another network, another hit of connectivity.

Others stay but shift modes. Phones become more important. Some tether. Others just... Staring at screens that no longer glow with purpose.

You notice something strange: people are making eye contact now.

When everyone's connected to the internet, no one needs to connect to each other. But now, disconnected, the coffee shop becomes a room with people in it, not just nodes on a network.

The two women who were working separately start talking to each other. Shared frustration becomes conversation.

The older man sighs loudly. Looks around. Catches your eye. A moment of solidarity: we're all stuck here, offline, together.

This should be freeing, right The disconnection fantasy—log off, be present, mindfulness, whatever. It's claustrophobic.

Because you didn't choose this. If you'd chosen to work offline, that would be agency. But this is forced. The third place broke its promise. You only got one.

You try to work anyway. Open a document that's already downloaded. Start writing. But every 90 seconds you reflexively try to check email. The muscle memory of connectivity. Command-Tab to browser. No internet.

Fifteen minutes pass. Still down.

You look at your phone. You could hot spot. But that costs money. Like you're so dependent on connectivity that you'll buy it twice.

The barista makes an announcement: "Internet should be back in about 30 minutes!"

30 minutes.

Some people adjust. Pull out notebooks—actual paper. A few have given up entirely and are just on their phones, burning through data.

You close the laptop. What's the point? You open one of the books instead. The design theory one. Start reading. Reading a physical book in a coffee shop while everyone else desperately tries to get back online.

Around you, the coffee shop has become louder. More conversation. The soundscape has shifted from productive clicking to human voices.

Is this better? Worse? A different room entirely, even though nothing physical changed.

Finally, 11:58 AM, someone's laptop makes a chime. "It's back!"

Everyone simultaneously checks. Yes. Connected. The relief is palpable.

You open Slack. 47 messages. You're behind now. The 30-minute outage created work debt.

The coffee shop returns to its normal state. Heads down. Silence except for typing and the espresso machine.

The moment of eye contact, of shared human presence, evaporates. You're all back in your private bubbles, connected to the internet but disconnected from each other.

Third places are not just physical spaces anymore. They're hybrid spaces—physical rooms plus digital infrastructure. It's WiFi, bandwidth, electrical outlets.

When the digital infrastructure fails, the third place partially collapses. It reveals our dependency. We came for connectivity with a coffee aesthetic.

And connectivity is what allows us to be "alone together"—physically co-present but mentally elsewhere. Without it, we're forced to be actually here, with these actual people.

Which is supposed to be the dream. But it's not. And that makes all the difference.
