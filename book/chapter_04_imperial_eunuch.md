# The Imperial Eunuch

This room is a Loop. The Eunuch stands at the Red Gate because the logic of his existence is the threshold. He cannot go in, and he cannot go back. He is the Zeno's Arrow of the Empire, frozen in the millisecond before arrival.

The Center must remain undefined. The Emperor exists only to be *feared*. If the door were to open, the tension would collapse, and the room would dissolve. Therefore, the door remains locked. The bronze tortoise lock keeps the Mystery in.

The Eunuch's body mirrors this subtraction. To serve the Void, he became a Void. The surgery removed his biology so that he could become pure Geometry—a vector of obedience with no desire to deviate. He guards the *Bao* jar on his shelf as the receipt of his transaction with the Infinite.

Every morning, the paper slides under the door. Every morning, he stamps it. The order implies a Disorder somewhere in the provinces. But the provinces are ghosts. There is only the Gate, the Paper, the Stamp, and the Silence. He is trapped in a machine that produces nothing but its own continuation. He waits for the realization that the inside and the outside are identical.
