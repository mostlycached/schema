# The Plague Doctor

To understand the Plague Doctor, you must first understand the *Beak*. It is not a mask; it is a gas mask. The doctor believes that the plague is spread by "miasma"—bad air. To breathe the air of the sickroom is to die. So he wears a leather mask with a six-inch beak. Inside the beak, he stuffs a specific recipe of aromatics: dried rose petals, camphor, cloves, myrrh, and a sponge soaked in vinegar. He breathes through this filter. He is a walking potpourri in a city of rotting corpses. He pays attention to the Smell. If he can smell the decay, his filter has failed. He is constantly adjusting the herbs, refreshing the vinegar, trying to build a wall of scent between himself and death.

The Doctor pays attention to the Cane. It is a wooden stick, often tipped with a winged hourglass. It is his only point of contact with the world. He uses it to lift the bedsheets of the dying. He uses it to take a pulse. He uses it to push away the desperate people who try to grab his robes. He never touches a patient with his hands. The cane is an extension of his nervous system, a probe sent into the infected zone.

This mode of attention is a desperate attempt to impose order on chaos. The genealogy is one of Bureaucracy. The Plague Doctor is not a private physician; he is a municipal employee. He is hired by the city when the plague strikes. His contract is grim: he is paid a high salary, but he is forbidden from treating healthy people. He is the doctor of the damned. The genealogy is also one of Alchemy. The most prized remedy was *Theriac* (Venice Treacle). It was a black, sticky syrup made from 64 ingredients, including opium, cinnamon, and—crucially—viper's flesh. It was believed to be a universal antidote. The doctor would ferment it for years in great ceramic jars.

The Plague Doctor exists in the realm of the *Lazaretto*. This was the quarantine island of Venice. Ships arriving from the East were forced to dock there for forty days. It was a purgatory. The doctor patrolled the wards, checking the sailors for "buboes." This creates a unique *Habitus*. The doctor is a figure of terror. When he walks down the street, people run. Children throw stones. He is a harbinger of doom. If you see the doctor, it means your neighbor is dead. He wears a long coat of waxed leather, which is meant to repel the fleas that carry the disease, though he doesn't know about the fleas yet. He thinks the wax repels the "stickiness" of the miasma.

The tension in the Plague Doctor's world is the Failure of Knowledge. The doctor knows everything about the humors. He knows the position of Saturn and Mars. But he does not know what causes the plague. He is fighting a microscopic enemy (*Yersinia pestis*) with medieval weapons. The "Decay" is the realization that his science is useless. He bleeds the patients, and they die faster. He gives them Theriac, and they vomit. He is a high priest of a religion that has been abandoned by its god. The tension is between the Duty and the Fear. The doctor is human. He is terrified. Every morning, he checks his own armpits for the swelling. But he puts on the mask. He picks up the cane. He goes to work.

The Plague Doctor is a Public Health Officer. The optimization is Quarantine. The doctor enforces the isolation. He boards up the houses of the infected. He paints a red cross on the door. It is cruel, but it works. It is the only thing that works. He optimizes the survival of the herd by sacrificing the individual. The "Beak" evolves into the Hazmat Suit. The principle is the same: create a sealed environment for the body. The waxed leather becomes Tyvek. The herbs become a HEPA filter. The "Theriac" evolves into the Vaccine. We no longer use viper's flesh. We use attenuated viruses. But the concept is the same: we take a piece of the danger and introduce it to the body to create immunity.

The Doctor sits in his study. He takes off the mask. His face is pale, marked by the straps. He pays attention to the Silence. To be a Plague Doctor is to be Alone. You cannot hug your wife. You cannot play with your children. You are untouchable. He pours a glass of wine. He adds a drop of Theriac. He drinks it. He listens to the city outside. There are no carts. There are no church bells. The city is holding its breath. He looks at the mask on the table. The glass eyes stare back at him, empty and reflective. He wonders if he is the doctor or the disease. He wonders if, when the plague is over, anyone will remember that he stayed.
