# The Plague Doctor

The inhabitant of this room wears the architecture on his face. The Plague Doctor creates a shell of leather shaped like the beak of a bird. The air outside is a soup of Miasma, infinite invisible demons waiting to enter the lungs.

The Beak functions as a filter. The Doctor stuffs the nose-cone with herbs: dried rose petals, camphor, cloves, straw. He breathes through a portable garden. He carries his own spring in the middle of the winter of death. He looks out through two circles of glass, keeping the world framed and distant.

His coat is a wall of waxed canvas—the "Levantine Polish"—so the fluids of the sick slide off. He wears gloves. He holds a cane. He touches the patient with the stick, never the hand. He is a hermetically sealed vessel floating through a sea of contagion.

The city dies around him. Carts roll by, piling the bodies. "Bring out your dead." The Doctor walks among them, a crow of doom. They think he brings death, but he preserves life—his own.

He stands in the room of the dying, smelling the rot through the scent of the roses. He feels the sweat inside his leather skin. He has built a house detailed to the millimeter solely to keep the world Out. Yet he knows that eventually, the air always finds a crack.
