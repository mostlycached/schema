# The Coal Mine

The Miner pays attention to the Gas. It is not one thing; it is a spectrum of death. The *Firedamp* (Methane) is lighter than air, accumulating in the roof of the tunnel. It is odorless, invisible, and highly explosive. A spark from a pickaxe can ignite it, causing a blast that travels at the speed of sound. Then there is *Blackdamp* (Carbon Dioxide and Nitrogen). It is heavier than air, pooling on the floor like an invisible ocean. It does not explode; it suffocates. It is the "Silent Killer." If you walk into a pocket of Blackdamp, you don't gasp; you just fall asleep and never wake up.

The Miner pays attention to the Canary. The bird is not a pet; it is a biological sensor. The canary has a metabolism ten times faster than a human's. It breathes more air relative to its body size. If there is Carbon Monoxide (*Whitedamp*) in the air, the canary will sway on its perch long before the miner feels a headache. The miner watches the bird with the intensity of a mother watching a sick child. If the bird falls, everyone runs. It is a cruel but necessary symbiosis: the bird dies so the man can live.

This mode of attention is the engine of the Industrial Revolution. The coal mine is the basement of the modern world. Without the coal, there is no steam engine, no steel, no electricity. The genealogy is one of Darkness. The miner works in a world where the sun is a memory. The genealogy is also one of Childhood. In the 19th century, the "Trapper Boy" was the lowest rung on the ladder. A five-year-old boy would sit in total darkness for twelve hours a day, his only job to open and close the ventilation door for the coal carts. He was the human valve in the respiratory system of the mine.

The Miner exists in the realm of the Davy Lamp. Invented by Sir Humphry Davy in 1815, it is a lamp with a flame enclosed inside a fine wire mesh. The mesh acts as a flame arrestor. It absorbs the heat of the flame, preventing it from igniting the gas outside the lamp. It is a miracle of physics. But it is also a gas detector. If the flame turns blue and elongates, there is Firedamp. If the flame dims and goes out, there is Blackdamp. The miner carries his life in a brass lantern.

But worlds, like stars, are subject to decay. The tension in the Miner's world is the Obsolescence. The world is turning away from coal. It is dirty, it is carbon-intensive, it is the enemy of the climate. The "Decay" is the closed pit, the rusted headframe, the town with no jobs. The miner is no longer the hero of labor; he is the villain of the environment. The tension is between the Pride and the Poison. The miner is proud of his toughness. But the job kills him. *Silicosis* (Black Lung) is the price of the coal. The dust settles in the lungs, turning the tissue into scar. He trades his breath for the fire that warms the world.

The Miner is a Geological Surgeon. The optimization is Ventilation. The mine is a giant lung. Giant fans on the surface suck the air out, pulling fresh air down the shaft. The miner directs this air using brattice cloths and trap doors. He is constantly managing the atmosphere. He is terraforming a hostile planet every day. The "Canary" evolves into the Methanometer. The electronic sensor replaced the bird. It beeps when the gas levels rise. It is more accurate, but less emotional. The "Davy Lamp" evolves into the Cap Lamp. The electric light on the helmet changed the phenomenology of the mine. The beam follows the eyes. The miner can see where he looks.

The Miner steps out of the cage at the end of the shift. He is covered in black dust. The only white things are his eyes and his teeth. He pays attention to the Sky. To be a Miner is to appreciate the Surface. The air tastes sweet. The colors are impossibly bright. He walks to the bathhouse. He scrubs the coal from his skin. He coughs, a deep, rattling cough. He lights a cigarette, the flame flaring in the twilight. He looks at the smoke rising. He knows that down below, in the dark, the gas is waiting. The rock is waiting. But for now, he is out. He is alive. He is a man who has returned from the underworld.
