## Patterns

From these examples, some patterns:

1. **The Encounter** seeds work by **contagion** — something crosses from outside and reconfigures
2. **The Crisis** seeds work by **subtraction** — something is removed and can't be replaced
3. **The Practice** seeds work by **accumulation** — tiny changes become structural over time
4. **The Situation** seeds work by **context shift** — a different surround produces different subject
5. **The Object** seeds work by **affordance** — new capacities become available
6. **The Refusal** seeds work by **cessation** — what you stop doing opens what was blocked
7. **The Return** seeds work by **recursion** — going back is not going back
