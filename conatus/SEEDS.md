# Seeds: A Catalog of What Has Opened Lines of Flight

> What we call "encounters" are moments when an animism breaches the wound-structure long enough to be felt.

## 0. THE PRIMITIVE ANIMISMS

Before you chose anything, these forces were already gripping. Not metaphors — actual attractors that organize body-in-world before meaning arrives.

### The Elemental Grips

| Animism | What It Does | How You Feel It |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Earth** | Calls downward, toward density, burial, root-structure | The urge to lie down. Belonging to a place. The pull of the grave. |
| **Fire** | Consumes structure, radiates, transforms | The fever of conviction. Burning through. The moment before ash. |
| **Sea** | Dissolves boundary, makes everything continuous | The oceanic feeling. Merging. The terror of no shore. |
| **Height** | Creates vertigo, removes ground | The call of the void. The sublime. Falling in love. |
| **Jaw** | Grips, tears, speaks, devours | The locked mandible. Biting through. The voice that hasn't emerged. |

### The Abstract Grips

| Animism | What It Does | How You Feel It |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Gravity** | Wins slowly, pulls all trajectories toward collapse | Fatigue. Depression's weight. The horizontal calling. |
| **Night** | The permanent surround that day briefly interrupts | Dread. Sleep. The unseen that you've always known is there. |
| **Knife** | Divides, clarifies through cut, creates wound that won't close | Decision. The moment of no-return. What separated you. |

> Every seed below is an animism surfacing — a moment when the grip becomes visible.

---

## VIII. THE ONTOLOGICAL WOUNDS

*Why seeds fail to take root. The constraints that were installed before you could refuse.*

These are not crises — crises can be survived. These are the shapes of the container you're in. You can't crack them. You can only know you're in them.

### Temporal Wounds

| Wound | What It Forecloses |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Someone else's concept of time** | You can encounter the eternal (Spinoza, meditation, the mountain) but you're on a clock you didn't set. The weekend. The quarter. The five-year plan. The "by thirty." The appointment that interrupts. |
| **The irreversibility you've internalized** | The fork in the road model. The belief that what was lost is lost. The inability to see time as spiral, or as all-at-once. |
| **The death you can't hold** | You know you'll die but you don't *know*. This is not a crisis — it's the structure of consciousness avoiding itself. |

### Spatial Wounds

| Wound | What It Forecloses |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Limited conception of space** | You think you're "in" a room. You think territory is geometric. You can't feel the space you carry, the space you generate, the space as intensive. |
| **Ungraspability of higher dimensions** | Meditation cracks identification with thought, but you fall back into 3D selfhood. The mystical insight can't be sustained because the geometry of your attention is Euclidean. |
| **The body-as-boundary** | The skin is the edge. Inside/outside. The porosity is unbearable so you keep repairing the wall. |

### Ontological Foreclosures

| Wound | What It Forecloses |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Unplayed ontologies I've accepted** | Lives you never lived but agreed to foreclose: the one who stayed in the village. The one who joined the military. The celibate. The nomad. The one who doesn't have a career. These aren't fantasies — they're amputations you agreed to. |
| **The forms of measurement you didn't choose** | Age. Income. Metrics of success. Body weight. Follower counts. Even "freedom from metrics" is a metric in this world. You can't opt out of quantification. |
| **Language as cage** | You think in the language you were given. The grammar is the ontology. The seeds are filtered through words that precede you. What can't be said in your tongue can't take root. |
| **The affects you can't run** | There are feeling-states other cultures cultivate that you have no access to. *Saudade*, *mono no aware*, *toska*, *hiraeth*. These are not translatable because they require different nervous systems — trained by different grounds. |

## Patterns

From these examples, some patterns:

1. **The Encounter** — an animism finds a conduit and breaches
2. **The Crisis** — an animism arrives uninvited through subtraction
3. **The Practice** — voluntary submission to an animism's repetition until restructuring
4. **The Situation** — immersion in an animism-as-surround
5. **The Object** — an animism condensed into a thing that becomes portal
6. **The Refusal** — stopping feeding one, or finally obeying another
7. **The Return** — the animism's second call, because the wound never closed

**The wounds** are why even successful seeds don't sustain. The container reasserts itself. You crack the identification with thought, then an email comes. You have the mystical insight, then you need to pay rent. You're seized by Spinoza, but it's on someone else's clock.

## How the Animisms Relate

```
        HEIGHT
           ↑
           |
    FIRE ←───→ SEA
           |
           ↓
        GRAVITY

     KNIFE cuts through all
     NIGHT surrounds all
     JAW is where you meet all
     EARTH is what you stand on (or sink into)
```

---

## How the Wounds Constrain

Even if you find the right seed, the right animism:

- **Someone else's time** → you can't *dwell*
- **Limited spatial conception** → you can't *sustain the opening*  
- **Unplayed ontologies** → you can't *become else*
- **Language as cage** → you can't *think outside the grammar*

---

*Seeds: things that were small but became large. Not controllable, but encounterable.*

*Animisms: what was already gripping you. Not chosen, but possibly felt.*

*Wounds: what forecloses before you begin. Not cracked, but known.*
