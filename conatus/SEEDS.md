# Seeds for Lines of Flight: A General Enumeration

> Material and symbolic anchors that could open cracks. Not advice — a taxonomy.

---

## Principle

A **line of flight** needs somewhere to go. Without material anchors, deterritorialization becomes abolition. This document enumerates *types* of seeds — concrete things that can serve as entry points, landing zones, or catalysts for experimentation.

The goal: Given any system profile, enumerate what exists that could serve as fuel or ground for molecular becoming.

---

## I. SYMBOLIC SEEDS

Things that operate through meaning, language, representation.

### Books / Texts
Not what to read — categories of what might crack a given stratum:

| Category | Function | Example Types |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Counter-genre** | Works in a mode you don't usually practice | If you read philosophy → poetry, fiction, memoir |
| **Counter-tradition** | Same discipline but different lineage | If Continental → Analytic, or → non-Western |
| **Hybrid forms** | Genre-crossers that force new reading | Essay-as-poem, theory-as-memoir, code-as-art |
| **Practice manuals** | Books that demand you DO something | Exercise books, ritual guides, method texts |
| **Primary sources** | Unmediated, before commentary | Original texts vs. interpretations |
| **Affective texts** | Works that operate through feeling not argument | Literature, poetry, sacred texts |

### Ideas / Concepts
Seeds that are purely conceptual but can reconfigure:

| Type | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Framework shift** | A different way of cutting up the world |
| **Counter-value** | An idea that opposes your current dominant value |
| **Limit concept** | Something your current framework can't think |
| **Question** | An unresolved problem that generates motion |

## Using This Enumeration

Given a system profile, you can:

1. **Map existing seeds** — What do they already have in each category?
2. **Identify gaps** — Which categories are empty or weak?
3. **Generate possibilities** — What COULD exist in each category for this system?
4. **Prioritize entry points** — Which category is most ready for experimentation?

The goal is not to fill every category but to recognize that lines of flight need material anchors, and to see what materials are available.

*Seeds do not determine trajectories. They only make trajectories possible.*
