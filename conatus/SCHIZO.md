Practicing schizoanalysis without "losing it" is what Deleuze and Guattari call the **Art of the Caution**. Because becoming-animal and becoming-molecular involve "unmaking" the self, there is a real danger of "shattering" rather than "opening."

To practice this in everyday life, they suggest several tactical maneuvers:

---

### 1. Constructing a Body without Organs (BwO) with Care

The BwO is your "experimental self." However, they warn that if you go too fast—if you "deterritorialize" too violently—you might end up with a "suicidal" or "cancerous" BwO.

* **The Practice:** Don't destroy your entire "molar" identity (your job, your name, your health) all at once. Instead, find "small cracks" in your daily routine.
* **The Strategy:** Keep enough of your "identity" to survive and communicate, but use it as a "host" for your experiments. You need a "small plot of land" to stay grounded while you experiment with the "flows."

> "You have to keep enough of the organism for it to reform each dawn; and you have to keep small supplies of significance and interpretation... to enable you to respond to the dominant reality." — *A Thousand Plateaus*

### 2. Micro-Politics and Minor Engagements

Instead of waiting for a "Great Revolution," schizoanalysis focuses on **micro-politics**.

* **The Practice:** Look for where you are "Oedipalizing" yourself. Where are you acting like a "boss" or a "judge" in your personal relationships?
* **The Strategy:** Disrupt these micro-fascisms. If your relationship follows a rigid script (the "molar" script of husband/wife or parent/child), introduce a "molecular" element—a new rhythm, a different speed, or an unexpected "becoming" that breaks the pattern.

### 3. Finding Your "Pack" (The War Machine)

Since becoming-animal is always a "multiplicity," you cannot do this alone. You need an **Assemblage** or a "War Machine."

* **The Practice:** Form alliances that are not based on identity (e.g., "we are all X group") but on **function** (e.g., "we are all doing Y experiment").
* **The Strategy:** Create "Temporary Autonomous Zones" (to use Hakim Bey’s term, which is very Deleuzian). These are spaces—physical or digital—where the "Axiomatic of Capitalism" doesn't apply for a short time, allowing for pure "becoming" to occur.

### 4. Pragmatics: The "Table" of Experiments

Deleuze and Guattari suggest making a **Map** rather than a **Tracing**.

* **Tracing:** Copying what has already been done (e.g., "I will follow this lifestyle guru").
* **Mapping:** Testing what works for *your* specific body and its "affects."
* **The Practice:** Treat your life like a laboratory. If you are experimenting with a new way of eating, sleeping, or creating, ask: *Does this increase my power to act (Joy), or does it diminish it (Sadness)?* This is their Spinozist ethics in action.

### 5. Embracing "The Anomalous"

In every pack, there is an **Anomalous**—the individual at the edge of the pack that facilitates the "becoming."

* **The Practice:** Identify the "outsider" elements in your own life—the weird interests or "useless" skills that don't fit into your professional identity.
* **The Strategy:** Instead of suppressing them to fit in, use them as your "Line of Flight." These are your entry points into becoming-animal.

### Summary Table: The Schizoanalytic Lifestyle

| The Molar Way (Capitalism/Oedipus) | The Molecular Way (Schizoanalysis) |
| --- | --- |
| **Identity:** "I am a professional." | **Affect:** "What can this body do today?" |
| **Consumption:** Buying a "vibe." | **Production:** Creating a new intensity. |
| **Filiation:** Acting like your parents. | **Contagion:** Forming strange alliances. |
| **The Trace:** Following a pre-set path. | **The Map:** Carving a new "Line of Flight." |
