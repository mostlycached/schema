## Simulation Trace

### Step 1: ✅ SUCCESS

**Encounter**: Heavy maximum attempt failed

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Initial State

#### Proposals

**Controlled Accommodation** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*Enables the agent to carefully and precisely interact with its environment, even under duress, by prioritizing controlled actions and adapting to limitations rather than forcing solutions. It focuses ...*

Affect: "Calibrated Resilience"

> Critic: While 'Controlled Accommodation' sounds adaptive, it risks becoming a rationalization for accepting limitations without truly pushing boundaries, potentially hindering growth and innovation. The 'Calibrated Resilience' affect feels more like resignation than genuine strength.

**Final Stance**: Controlled Accommodation

**Environment Viability**: 0.94

---

### Step 2: ❌ FAILURE

**Encounter**: Injury during set

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Controlled Accommodation

#### Proposals

**Resilient Collaboration** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*This stance enables the agent to overcome setbacks and injuries by leveraging collaborative problem-solving and shared intentionality, while minimizing reliance on precise individual control and toler...*

Affect: "Forged Solidarity"

> Critic: While 'Resilient Collaboration' sounds positive, it risks becoming a comfortable way to avoid addressing the root causes of the injury and shifts focus away from individual responsibility and potentially necessary systemic changes, becoming a becoming-imperceptible of the individual into the collective.

**Final Stance**: Resilient Collaboration

**Environment Viability**: 0.24

---

### Step 3: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Encounter**: Coach yells

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Resilient Collaboration

#### Proposals

**Focused Precision** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*This stance enables the agent to perform intricate tasks under pressure, prioritizing accuracy and control over collaborative harmony. It allows for a detached, almost clinical approach to problem-sol...*

Affect: "Calibrated Detachment"

> Critic: While 'Focused Precision' offers a becoming-machine, prioritizing accuracy, it risks becoming a rigid identity that avoids the becoming-animal of collaborative problem-solving under duress. The 'Calibrated Detachment' affect suggests a retreat from the intensity of the situation rather than a genuine line of flight towards a more effective mode of engagement.

**Final Stance**: Focused Precision

**Environment Viability**: 0.34
