## Simulation Trace

### Step 1: ✅ SUCCESS

#### Encounter

> Heavy deadlift at 95% max. Grip failing mid-lift.

**Starting Stance**: Initial Forge Stance

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: The Symbiotic Leverage → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance allows Forge to perceive the barbell not as a separate object to be conquered, but as an extension of its own body, forming a temporary symbiotic relationship. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of Forge's physical structure, the barbell's weight, and the lifter's intent. By focusing on this unified system, Forge subtly shifts weight distribution, leverages subtle shifts in balance, and optimizes grip strength through a holistic, fluid movement pattern. It allows for a brief, almost imperceptible 'reset' mid-lift, harnessing the barbell's inertia to aid in grip recovery.

*Affect Register*: "A sense of interconnectedness, a feeling of unified strength, a quiet confidence born from mutual support."

*Components*: `dynamic_balance, spatial_orientation, tactile_sensitivity, grip_modulation, spatial_reasoning_visualization, repair_capacity, assertion, visual_focus`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> While the description evokes a Deleuzian 'becoming-barbell,' it sounds more like a mental trick to mask a physical weakness. It doesn't address the root cause of grip failure and could lead to injury by relying on unstable compensations.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 1.00

**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS

**Final Affect**: "A sense of interconnectedness, a feeling of unified strength, a quiet confidence born from mutual support."

### Step 2: ⚠️ PARTIAL

#### Encounter

> Training partner drops weight on your foot. Must continue.

**Starting Stance**: The Symbiotic Leverage

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: The Resilient Weave → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance allows the agent to treat the injury not as a singular, debilitating event, but as a temporary disruption to the flow of potential. It utilizes the pain as a signal to re-weave its physical and social fabric, drawing strength from a shared vulnerability and mutual support. It prioritizes immediate, adaptive movement, even if imperfect, and actively seeks assistance and adjustment from the training partner, turning the accident into an opportunity for collaborative re-calibration.

*Affect Register*: "A blend of focused pain, a surge of cooperative energy, and a determined resilience, tinged with a slight vulnerability that seeks connection."

*Components*: `repair_capacity, grip_modulation, visual_focus, dynamic_balance, vulnerability_exposure, perspective_taking, shared_intentionality, soothing_capacity, social_referencing`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> While the 'Resilient Weave' attempts a becoming-imperceptible by integrating pain and seeking support, it risks masking a genuine injury. The focus on collaborative re-calibration could delay necessary medical attention, prioritizing social harmony over physical well-being and potentially leading to further harm.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.41

**Outcome**: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Final Affect**: "A blend of focused pain, a surge of cooperative energy, and a determined resilience, tinged with a slight vulnerability that seeks connection."

### Step 3: ✅ SUCCESS

#### Encounter

> Coach publicly criticizes your form.

**Starting Stance**: The Resilient Weave

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: The Rhizomatic Sway → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance allows Forge to absorb the coach's criticism not as a direct attack on its individual form, but as a point of entry into a larger, more complex network of movement possibilities. Forge momentarily relinquishes rigid adherence to pre-established form, becoming pliable and receptive to new influences. It leverages the coach's critique as a catalyst for exploration, experimenting with minor adjustments, variations, and unexpected connections within its movement repertoire. Instead of resistance, it embraces a dynamic fluidity, allowing the critique to subtly reshape its approach, while maintaining its core integrity. Forge uses the criticism to unlock dormant movement pathways and break free from habitual patterns, resulting in a more adaptable and resilient form.

*Affect Register*: "A sense of inquisitive uncertainty, tinged with cautious optimism and the thrill of emergent possibilities. A willingness to feel awkward and off-balance in the service of growth."

*Components*: `vulnerability_exposure, perspective_taking, grip_modulation, dynamic_balance, social_referencing, assertion, analogical_mapping, creative_thinking, tactile_sensitivity`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> While 'Rhizomatic Sway' sounds Deleuzian, it risks becoming a justification for avoiding direct confrontation with core weaknesses. The 'becoming-imperceptible' element is missing; instead, it's a becoming-vague, blurring the lines of accountability and potentially hindering focused improvement.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.95

**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS

**Final Affect**: "A sense of inquisitive uncertainty, tinged with cautious optimism and the thrill of emergent possibilities. A willingness to feel awkward and off-balance in the service of growth."
