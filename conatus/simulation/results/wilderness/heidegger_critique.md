## Simulation Trace

### Step 1: ⚠️ PARTIAL

#### Encounter

> Storm rolls in. Shelter is hours away.

**Starting Stance**: Initial Wilderness Stance

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: Primal-Weaving → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance enables the agent to perceive the immediate environment not as an obstacle, but as a raw material to be interwoven into a temporary refuge. It shifts the focus from reaching a distant, abstract 'shelter' to actively crafting a local, concrete response to the storm using available resources and immediate spatial awareness. The agent looks for natural formations and materials that can be adapted and combined for immediate protection. It involves a kinesthetic intelligence - a 'feel' for how the environment can be manipulated to offer shelter.

*Affect Register*: "A sense of grounded urgency, a focused calm amidst rising anxiety, and a feeling of being intrinsically connected to the immediate surroundings."

*Components*: `spatial_orientation, motor_adaptation, peripheral_awareness, problem_solving, risk_assessment, repair_capacity, visual_attention_focus, frustration_tolerance, threat_detection`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> While 'Primal-Weaving' encourages resourceful action, it risks becoming a distraction from the very real danger. The agent might become absorbed in the *doing* and lose sight of the urgency of finding or creating truly adequate shelter, potentially leading to a false sense of security.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.42

**Outcome**: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Final Affect**: "A sense of grounded urgency, a focused calm amidst rising anxiety, and a feeling of being intrinsically connected to the immediate surroundings."

### Step 2: ❌ FAILURE

#### Encounter

> Trail markers have disappeared.

**Starting Stance**: Primal-Weaving

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: Primal-Weaving → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance enables the agent to perceive the immediate environment not as an obstacle, but as a raw material to be interwoven into a temporary refuge. It shifts the focus from reaching a distant, abstract 'shelter' to actively crafting a local, concrete response to the storm using available resources and immediate spatial awareness. The agent looks for natural formations and materials that can be adapted and combined for immediate protection. It involves a kinesthetic intelligence - a 'feel' for how the environment can be manipulated to offer shelter.

*Affect Register*: "A sense of grounded urgency, a focused calm amidst rising anxiety, and a feeling of being intrinsically connected to the immediate surroundings."

*Components*: `spatial_orientation, motor_adaptation, peripheral_awareness, problem_solving, risk_assessment, repair_capacity, visual_attention_focus, frustration_tolerance, threat_detection`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> While 'Primal-Weaving' offers a practical response to immediate exposure, it risks becoming a distraction from the fundamental problem of lost navigation. It's a plausible coping mechanism, but might be a comfortable avoidance of the harder task of finding the trail or accepting the reality of being lost.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.00

**Outcome**: ❌ FAILURE

**Final Affect**: "A sense of grounded urgency, a focused calm amidst rising anxiety, and a feeling of being intrinsically connected to the immediate surroundings."

### Step 3: ❌ FAILURE

#### Encounter

> Night falls and you have no light.

**Starting Stance**: Primal-Weaving

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: Primal-Weaving → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance enables the agent to perceive the immediate environment not as an obstacle, but as a raw material to be interwoven into a temporary refuge. It shifts the focus from reaching a distant, abstract 'shelter' to actively crafting a local, concrete response to the storm using available resources and immediate spatial awareness. The agent looks for natural formations and materials that can be adapted and combined for immediate protection. It involves a kinesthetic intelligence - a 'feel' for how the environment can be manipulated to offer shelter.

*Affect Register*: "A sense of grounded urgency, a focused calm amidst rising anxiety, and a feeling of being intrinsically connected to the immediate surroundings."

*Components*: `spatial_orientation, motor_adaptation, peripheral_awareness, problem_solving, risk_assessment, repair_capacity, visual_attention_focus, frustration_tolerance, threat_detection`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> While 'Primal-Weaving' offers a potentially useful reframing of the situation, it risks becoming a distraction from the core problem: the absence of light and the increased vulnerability it creates. It's too easy to become absorbed in the weaving and ignore the looming dangers that darkness conceals, thus fleeing into the 'they-self' of busyness.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.21

**Outcome**: ❌ FAILURE

**Final Affect**: "A sense of grounded urgency, a focused calm amidst rising anxiety, and a feeling of being intrinsically connected to the immediate surroundings."
