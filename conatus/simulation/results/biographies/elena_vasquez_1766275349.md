## The LifeWorld

> **Central Concern**: *Elena's life is fundamentally about ensuring her son, Mateo, thrives while simultaneously caring for her ailing mother, Rosa, and trying to salvage her own dreams.*

### Places

- **The Casa Familiar on Willow Creek** (family_home): It's been in Rosa's family for generations, the only place Mateo has ever known, and represents the weight of Elena's familial responsibilities. — The ever-present scent of VapoRub and simmering arroz con pollo., The chipped paint on the porch swing, a constant reminder of undone repairs.
- **Sunshine Daycare Center** (workplace): It's Elena's escape and her livelihood, providing a small income and a sense of purpose beyond her immediate family's needs. — The cacophony of children's laughter and singing., The lingering smell of disinfectant and crayons.
- **Rosa's Room** (hospital): It's the epicenter of Elena's caretaking, a constant reminder of her mother's declining health and the fragility of life. — The rhythmic beeping of the oxygen concentrator., The soft, worn texture of Rosa's rosary beads.

### Meaningful Objects

- **Mateo's well-worn copy of 'Goodnight Moon'**: Represents the unconditional love and responsibility she feels for her son; a tangible reminder of the joy he brings to her life amidst the hardship. (A gift from a social worker when Mateo was born.)
- **Rosa's hand-embroidered shawl**: A symbol of Rosa's strength and creativity; a reminder of the woman her mother used to be and a connection to her family history. (Made by Rosa when Elena was a child.)

### Daily Practices

- **Bedtime Story Ritual** (8:00 PM, Mateo's bedroom in the Casa Familiar): It's a sacred time for bonding with Mateo and creates a sense of normalcy and security in his life despite the chaotic circumstances.
- **Morning Meds Round** (7:00 AM, Rosa's Room in the Casa Familiar): It's crucial for maintaining Rosa's health and comfort, and Elena feels a deep responsibility to ensure her mother receives the best possible care.

### Body

- **Chronic lower back pain from lifting and carrying Mateo and assisting Rosa.**: Limits her ability to participate in physical activities with Mateo and makes it difficult to sleep comfortably.
