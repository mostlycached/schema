## Simulation Trace

### Step 1: ⚠️ PARTIAL

#### Encounter

> Intelligence report contradicts your strategy.

**Starting Stance**: Initial War_Room Stance

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: Embodied Skepticism → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance allows for a physical and social recalibration in response to contradictory intelligence. Instead of immediate dismissal or acceptance, it embodies a questioning posture. The agent physically shifts weight, subtly turns away from the projected strategy (if being displayed), and initiates a brief period of observing the reactions of other key personnel in the room. It's a deliberate act of seeking non-verbal confirmation or dissent, using body language as a form of distributed cognition before committing to a revised course of action. It signals doubt without outright confrontation, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the situation and the potential implications of the contradictory intelligence.

*Affect Register*: "Disquiet mixed with calculated curiosity"

*Components*: `vulnerability_exposure, visual_focus, spatial_reasoning_visualization, perspective_taking, social_hierarchy_assessment, gaze_following, social_reading, threat_detection, social_referencing, emotional_regulation, joint_attention, sustained_attention, auditory_attention, social_interaction, visual_attention_focus, spatial_orientation`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> The proposed stance leans heavily on performative doubt and social cues, delaying actual engagement with the contradictory intelligence. The absolute metaphor at play is 'Doubt as a Dance,' prioritizing social maneuvering over decisive action, and the unconceptualizable is the potential for outright error in the initial plan.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.44

**Outcome**: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Final Affect**: "Disquiet mixed with calculated curiosity"

### Step 2: ✅ SUCCESS

#### Encounter

> Key ally defects to opposition.

**Starting Stance**: Embodied Skepticism

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: Embodied Skepticism → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance allows for a physical and social recalibration in response to contradictory intelligence. Instead of immediate dismissal or acceptance, it embodies a questioning posture. The agent physically shifts weight, subtly turns away from the projected strategy (if being displayed), and initiates a brief period of observing the reactions of other key personnel in the room. It's a deliberate act of seeking non-verbal confirmation or dissent, using body language as a form of distributed cognition before committing to a revised course of action. It signals doubt without outright confrontation, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the situation and the potential implications of the contradictory intelligence.

*Affect Register*: "Disquiet mixed with calculated curiosity"

*Components*: `vulnerability_exposure, visual_focus, spatial_reasoning_visualization, perspective_taking, social_hierarchy_assessment, gaze_following, social_reading, threat_detection, social_referencing, emotional_regulation, joint_attention, sustained_attention, auditory_attention, social_interaction, visual_attention_focus, spatial_orientation`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> The absolute metaphor at play is 'delay as wisdom,' which masks a deeper fear of making a wrong decision. While observation is valuable, the proposed stance risks appearing indecisive and allows the defector's actions to dictate the response, rather than proactively shaping the narrative.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.93

**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS

**Final Affect**: "Disquiet mixed with calculated curiosity"

### Step 3: ❌ FAILURE

#### Encounter

> Decision deadline in 60 seconds.

**Starting Stance**: Embodied Skepticism

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: Embodied Skepticism → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance allows for a physical and social recalibration in response to contradictory intelligence. Instead of immediate dismissal or acceptance, it embodies a questioning posture. The agent physically shifts weight, subtly turns away from the projected strategy (if being displayed), and initiates a brief period of observing the reactions of other key personnel in the room.

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> The absolute metaphor at play is 'the body as a lie detector,' but it's being used to *defer* judgment rather than to sharpen it. While seeking non-verbal cues can be useful, this proposal risks becoming a performative avoidance of responsibility, masking indecision as 'nuanced understanding'.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.17

**Outcome**: ❌ FAILURE

**Final Affect**: "Disquiet mixed with calculated curiosity"
