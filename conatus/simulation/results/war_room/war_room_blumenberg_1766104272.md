## Simulation Trace

### Step 1: ✅ SUCCESS

**Encounter**: Satellite feed lost

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Initial State

#### Proposals

**Focused Vigil** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*This stance enables the agent to maintain a heightened state of awareness and responsiveness to potential threats, even when faced with disruptions in primary sensory inputs. It prioritizes threat det...*

Affect: "Taut Awareness"

> Critic: The metaphor at work is 'watchman on the wall', but without the wall. 'Taut Awareness' sounds good, but it's mostly a re-description of being stressed while lacking information. It avoids confronting the fundamental problem of *no* information.

**Final Stance**: Focused Vigil

**Environment Viability**: 0.79

### Step 2: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Encounter**: Ally betrays

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Focused Vigil

#### Proposals

**Open Embrace** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*Enables the agent to navigate betrayal by prioritizing self-compassion, clear communication of needs, and boundary re-establishment, fostering resilience and preventing future exploitation.*

Affect: "Tender Resilience"

> Critic: The 'Open Embrace' stance, while seemingly promoting resilience, risks becoming a rationalization for repeated exploitation by prioritizing self-compassion over strategic assessment and potentially necessary distancing. The 'Tender Resilience' affect sounds more like a coping mechanism than a genuine shift in power dynamics.

**Final Stance**: Open Embrace

**Environment Viability**: 0.54

### Step 3: ✅ SUCCESS

**Encounter**: Enemy surrounds

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Open Embrace

#### Proposals

**Coiled Precision** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*Enables focused, strategic response to immediate threats while conserving energy and maintaining situational awareness. Prioritizes survival and tactical advantage over connection or open communicatio...*

Affect: "Diamond Shard"

> Critic: The 'Coiled Precision' metaphor suggests a reactive stance, potentially missing opportunities for proactive solutions. While it prioritizes survival, it risks isolating the entity and limiting its long-term options, making it a potentially comfortable but ultimately limiting adaptation.

**Final Stance**: Coiled Precision

**Environment Viability**: 0.82
