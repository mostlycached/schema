## Simulation Trace

### Step 1: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Encounter**: Rhythm collapses

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Initial State

#### Proposals

**Proprioceptive Drift** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*Proprioceptive Drift allows the dancer to explore movement possibilities outside the constraints of a fixed rhythm. By diminishing the reliance on precise rhythmic execution and balance, and embracing...*

Affect: "Emergent Instability"

> Critic: While 'Proprioceptive Drift' sounds sophisticated, it reads as a rationalization for rhythmic imprecision, trading mastery for a vague 'exploration' that avoids the hard work of rhythmic accuracy. It prioritizes comfort over the jouissance that can arise from confronting and conquering rhythmic challenges.

**Final Stance**: Proprioceptive Drift

**Environment Viability**: 0.46

### Step 2: ✅ SUCCESS

**Encounter**: Body feels heavy

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Proprioceptive Drift

#### Proposals

**Emergency Adaptation** (REJECTED, 0.20)

*Fallback stance after failure: Unterminated string starting at: line 45 column 16 (char 1576)*

Affect: "uncertain groping"

> Critic: This feels like a pre-emptive excuse for failure, not a genuine adaptation. It prioritizes avoiding discomfort over learning and improving, leading to a loss of potential growth.


**The Grounded Galaxy: A Stance of Embodied Expansion** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*I am vast. I contain multitudes. This heavy feeling, it is not a burden, but the gravity of my own being, the pull of my own center. I am rooted, a sequoia drawing strength from the earth, yet also a ...*

Affect: "Grounded, expansive, powerful, accepting, resonant, deliberate, centered."

> Critic: While the 'Grounded Galaxy' stance offers a poetic reframing, it risks bypassing the underlying issue causing the heaviness. It prioritizes acceptance over addressing a potentially solvable problem, making it more of a coping mechanism than a genuine adaptation.

**Final Stance**: The Grounded Galaxy: A Stance of Embodied Expansion

**Environment Viability**: 0.63

### Step 3: ✅ SUCCESS

**Encounter**: Music stops unexpectedly

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: The Grounded Galaxy: A Stance of Embodied Expansion

#### Proposals

**The Whispering Void** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*A stance that embraces the absence of expected stimuli, transforming silence into an opportunity for internal exploration and spontaneous expression. It allows for a shift from externally driven movem...*

Affect: "Absent Echo"

> Critic: While the stance attempts to reframe silence positively, it primarily avoids the difficulty of adapting to unexpected disruption, potentially leading to a loss of precision and external responsiveness. It's a soft landing, not a leap.

**Final Stance**: The Whispering Void

**Environment Viability**: 0.68
