## Simulation Trace

### Step 1: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Encounter**: Silence is absolute

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Initial State

#### Proposals

**Attentive Suspension** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*This stance enables the agent to passively receive and process information in the face of absolute silence, without the need to assert, repair, or soothe. It allows for deep observation and tolerance ...*

Affect: "Stillness Observing"

> Critic: While 'Attentive Suspension' sounds profound, it risks becoming a passive resignation to the void, avoiding the difficult work of actively engaging with the silence and forging one's own meaning. It leans toward a comfortable, albeit seemingly sophisticated, form of distraction from Being-toward-death.

**Final Stance**: Attentive Suspension

**Environment Viability**: 0.37

### Step 2: ❌ FAILURE

**Encounter**: Identity dissolves

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Attentive Suspension

#### Proposals

**Emergency Adaptation** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*Fallback stance after failure: Unterminated string starting at: line 52 column 16 (char 1544)*

Affect: "uncertain groping"

> Critic: Shifting to an 'emergency adaptation' that feels like 'uncertain groping' suggests a flight from confronting the root cause of the initial failure, potentially just masking the problem with a new, equally fragile stance. The lack of clear capability gain indicates this is more about damage control than genuine growth.

**Final Stance**: Emergency Adaptation

**Environment Viability**: 0.07

### Step 3: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Encounter**: Time stops

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Emergency Adaptation

#### Proposals

**Suspended Attunement** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*Enables a state of receptive observation and subtle interaction, even when conventional action is impossible. It allows for deep processing of sensory input and nuanced response based on subtle cues, ...*

Affect: "Stillness Permeated"

> Critic: While 'Suspended Attunement' sounds profound, it risks becoming a sophisticated form of inaction, masking the fear of powerlessness with a veneer of receptive observation. It's unclear if this stance genuinely allows for a *different* kind of effective response, or merely justifies paralysis.

**Final Stance**: Suspended Attunement

**Environment Viability**: 0.47
