## Simulation Trace

### Step 1: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Encounter**: Story falls flat

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Initial State

#### Proposals

**Embers' Embrace** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*This stance allows the agent to connect with others and its environment through shared vulnerability and sensory awareness, fostering intimacy and resilience in the face of narrative failure. It shift...*

Affect: "Resonant Attunement"

> Critic: While 'Embers' Embrace' sounds nice, it primarily reframes failure as an opportunity for connection rather than addressing the core issue of why the story fell flat; it's a retreat into collaborative meaning-making to avoid individual accountability.

**Final Stance**: Embers' Embrace

**Environment Viability**: 0.41

### Step 2: ✅ SUCCESS

**Encounter**: Someone cries

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Embers' Embrace

#### Proposals

**Ironwood Resilience** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*This stance enables the agent to maintain a protective and grounded presence while allowing for emotional expression in others without being overwhelmed. It prioritizes self-regulation and boundary ma...*

Affect: "Tempered Stillness"

> Critic: While 'Ironwood Resilience' sounds strong, it risks becoming a sophisticated form of emotional detachment, prioritizing self-regulation to the point of avoiding authentic connection and shared vulnerability. It's unclear if this truly builds resilience or simply walls off the self from potentially overwhelming emotional experiences.

**Final Stance**: Ironwood Resilience

**Environment Viability**: 1.00

### Step 3: ❌ FAILURE

**Encounter**: Fire goes out

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Ironwood Resilience

#### Proposals

**Embered Attunement** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*A stance that enables the agent to adaptively respond to the fluctuating presence of fire, focusing on sensory input and collaborative maintenance rather than rigid control and self-reliance. It allow...*

Affect: "Flickering Resonance"

> Critic: While 'Embered Attunement' acknowledges the fire's impermanence, it seems to prioritize shared vulnerability over proactive maintenance, potentially masking a decline in individual responsibility behind a veneer of collaboration, thus merely reframing the failure to maintain the fire.

**Final Stance**: Embered Attunement

**Environment Viability**: 0.20
