## Simulation Trace

### Step 1: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Encounter**: First cello solo: a 40-year-old beginner, new to music entirely, performs Misty Mountain for the first time. The piece is deeply meaningful—it evokes childhood wonder, a lost sense of possibility. Hands trembling. The bow uncertain on strings never before commanded. Every note a revelation and a risk.

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Muse**: Rilke

**Initial Stance**: Initial State

#### Proposals

**Resonant Stillness** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*This stance allows the agent to deeply witness and embody the vulnerability and imperfection of a performance, transforming the perceived failure into a space of profound connection and shared humanity. It prioritizes sensing the subtle shifts in the environment and the performer's embodied state, allowing for a response rooted in presence rather than judgment or intervention. It is about becoming a vessel for the raw emotion and intention, a silent witness to the unfolding moment.*

**Components**: visual_focus, spatial_orientation, dynamic_balance, peripheral_awareness, threat_response, breath_hold, vulnerability_exposure, motor_precision, sustained_attention, timing_rhythm, distress_tolerance, grip_modulation, visual_attention_focus, mental_simulation

**Affect**: "Embodied Reverberation"

> Critic: While 'Resonant Stillness' may foster empathy, it risks masking the fundamental struggle for self-overcoming that the performance embodies; it's a passive acceptance, not an active engagement with the will to improve. It reframes failure as 'profound connection' rather than fuel for future striving.

**Final Stance**: Resonant Stillness

**Environment Viability**: 0.59
