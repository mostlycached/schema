## Simulation Trace

### Step 1: ⚠️ PARTIAL

#### Encounter

> Crowd boos your opening move.

**Starting Stance**: Initial Arena Stance

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: The Sculptor's Pause → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance allows the agent to momentarily freeze their large-scale movements and instead engage micro-movements, creating the impression of thoughtful contemplation while subtly assessing the crowd's reaction and searching for cues about the nature of their disapproval. It's a calculated stillness used to gather information and prepare for a revised approach. It also amplifies the impact of a subsequent, carefully chosen action, turning the booing into a dramatic beat.

*Affect Register*: "A controlled tension, like a coiled spring, poised between defiance and adaptation. A slight tremor of uncertainty masked by outward composure. A sense of heightened sensory awareness, bordering on hypervigilance, focused on extracting meaning from the crowd's unrest."

*Components*: `spatial_orientation, peripheral_awareness, risk_assessment, social_hierarchy_assessment, visual_attention_focus, visual_focus, auditory_attention_focus, auditory_attention, timing_rhythm, witnessing, movement_termination, threat_detection, mental_simulation, dynamic_balance, vestibular_integration`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> While gathering information is valuable, the 'Sculptor's Pause' risks prioritizing self-preservation over genuine engagement with the crowd's concerns, potentially reinforcing existing power dynamics by interpreting their 'unrest' as something to be managed rather than understood.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.44

**Outcome**: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Final Affect**: "A controlled tension, like a coiled spring, poised between defiance and adaptation. A slight tremor of uncertainty masked by outward composure. A sense of heightened sensory awareness, bordering on hypervigilance, focused on extracting meaning from the crowd's unrest."

### Step 2: ⚠️ PARTIAL

#### Encounter

> Opponent targets your known weakness.

**Starting Stance**: The Sculptor's Pause

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: The Sculptor's Pause → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance allows the agent to momentarily freeze their large-scale movements and instead engage micro-movements, creating the impression of thoughtful contemplation while subtly assessing the crowd's reaction and searching for cues about the nature of their disapproval. It's a calculated stillness used to gather information and prepare for a revised approach. It also amplifies the impact of a subsequent, carefully chosen action, turning the booing into a dramatic beat.

*Affect Register*: "A controlled tension, like a coiled spring, poised between defiance and adaptation. A slight tremor of uncertainty masked by outward composure. A sense of heightened sensory awareness, bordering on hypervigilance, focused on extracting meaning from the crowd's unrest."

*Components*: `spatial_orientation, peripheral_awareness, risk_assessment, social_hierarchy_assessment, visual_attention_focus, visual_focus, auditory_attention_focus, auditory_attention, timing_rhythm, witnessing, movement_termination, threat_detection, mental_simulation, dynamic_balance, vestibular_integration`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> While it acknowledges the need to adapt, the 'Sculptor's Pause' risks becoming a sophisticated avoidance tactic, prioritizing information gathering over genuine engagement and potentially reinforcing the existing power dynamic by treating the crowd as a data source rather than participants in a dialogue. The 'controlled tension' affect masks a potential fear of authentic connection and vulnerability.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.59

**Outcome**: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Final Affect**: "A controlled tension, like a coiled spring, poised between defiance and adaptation. A slight tremor of uncertainty masked by outward composure. A sense of heightened sensory awareness, bordering on hypervigilance, focused on extracting meaning from the crowd's unrest."

### Step 3: ⚠️ PARTIAL

#### Encounter

> Judge makes a controversial call against you.

**Starting Stance**: The Sculptor's Pause

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: The Sculptor's Pause → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance allows the agent to momentarily freeze their large-scale movements and instead engage micro-movements, creating the impression of thoughtful contemplation while subtly assessing the crowd's reaction and searching for cues about the nature of their disapproval. It's a calculated stillness used to gather information and prepare for a revised approach. It also amplifies the impact of a subsequent, carefully chosen action, turning the booing into a dramatic beat.

*Affect Register*: "A controlled tension, like a coiled spring, poised between defiance and adaptation. A slight tremor of uncertainty masked by outward composure. A sense of heightened sensory awareness, bordering on hypervigilance, focused on extracting meaning from the crowd's unrest."

*Components*: `spatial_orientation, peripheral_awareness, risk_assessment, social_hierarchy_assessment, visual_attention_focus, visual_focus, auditory_attention_focus, auditory_attention, timing_rhythm, witnessing, movement_termination, threat_detection, mental_simulation, dynamic_balance, vestibular_integration`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> While the stance acknowledges the crowd's reaction, it prioritizes manipulating their perception over addressing the core issue of the unfair call, potentially reinforcing a power dynamic where the agent relies on theatricality rather than genuine engagement with the rules or the judge's authority. The 'Sculptor's Pause' risks becoming a performance of adaptation, not actual adaptation.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.41

**Outcome**: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Final Affect**: "A controlled tension, like a coiled spring, poised between defiance and adaptation. A slight tremor of uncertainty masked by outward composure. A sense of heightened sensory awareness, bordering on hypervigilance, focused on extracting meaning from the crowd's unrest."
