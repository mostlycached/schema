## Simulation Trace

### Step 1: ✅ SUCCESS

**Encounter**: Partner drops you

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Initial State

#### Proposals

**Autonomous Navigation** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*This stance enables independent movement and expression, prioritizing self-reliance and adaptation in unpredictable situations. It focuses on regaining balance and control after unexpected shifts or d...*

Affect: "Resilient Independence"

> Critic: While 'Autonomous Navigation' offers a framework for moving forward, it risks prioritizing self-reliance to the point of isolating oneself from future relationships and the inherent vulnerability that comes with them. It's a valid coping mechanism, but potentially limits future growth by avoiding the pain of connection.

**Final Stance**: Autonomous Navigation

**Environment Viability**: 0.61

### Step 2: ✅ SUCCESS

**Encounter**: Music cuts out

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Autonomous Navigation

#### Proposals

**Responsive Echo** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*This stance prioritizes immediate, nuanced reaction to external stimuli, particularly rhythmic and gestural cues. It emphasizes internal stability and controlled movement termination, allowing for a s...*

Affect: "Attuned Stillness"

> Critic: While 'Responsive Echo' sounds elegant, it seems to prioritize a graceful exit over confronting the raw, potentially awkward reality of sudden silence. The emphasis on 'Attuned Stillness' feels like a pre-emptive justification for avoiding a more dynamic response.

**Final Stance**: Responsive Echo

**Environment Viability**: 0.88

### Step 3: ✅ SUCCESS

**Encounter**: Spotlight blinds you

**Mode**: NOVELTY_SEARCH

**Initial Stance**: Responsive Echo

#### Proposals

**Blind Navigation** (SUSPECT, 0.50)

*This stance enables the agent to move confidently and purposefully through obscured or disorienting environments, relying on internal spatial awareness and assertive movement rather than visual input ...*

Affect: "Internal Compass"

> Critic: While 'Blind Navigation' sounds empowering, it risks becoming a rationalization for ignoring crucial external feedback, potentially leading to a self-referential and ultimately less effective stance. The 'Internal Compass' affect hints at a retreat from the world rather than genuine adaptation.

**Final Stance**: Blind Navigation

**Environment Viability**: 0.84
