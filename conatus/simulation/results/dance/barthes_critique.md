## Simulation Trace

### Step 1: ❌ FAILURE

#### Encounter

> Partner stumbles. You must compensate mid-lift.

**Starting Stance**: Initial Dance Stance

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: The 'Narrative Salvage' Stance → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance enables the dancer to interpret the stumble not as a failure, but as a rupture in the expected narrative, an opportunity to rewrite the story of the dance in real-time. It allows for immediate, improvisational adaptation that acknowledges the error while seamlessly integrating it into a new, compelling sequence. It focuses on communicating resilience and artistic intention to the audience, turning a potential flaw into a moment of heightened expressiveness.

*Affect Register*: "Focused alertness with a tinge of playful defiance. A sense of improvisational creativity and the thrill of unexpected narrative shifts."

*Components*: `spatial_orientation, proprioception, dynamic_balance, motor_adaptation, gesture_communication, postural_adjustment, motor_pattern_recognition, assertion`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> While reframing can be useful, this leans heavily into rationalizing failure as a deliberate artistic choice. It risks prioritizing the *idea* of resilience over the actual execution and recovery of the dance.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.22

**Outcome**: ❌ FAILURE

**Final Affect**: "Focused alertness with a tinge of playful defiance. A sense of improvisational creativity and the thrill of unexpected narrative shifts."

### Step 2: ⚠️ PARTIAL

#### Encounter

> Music suddenly stops. Silence in the room.

**Starting Stance**: The 'Narrative Salvage' Stance

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: The 'Frozen Semiotic' Stance → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance suspends the immediate expectation of continued movement and instead focuses on the semiotic weight of the interruption itself. The dancer freezes in place, not as a mere cessation of motion, but as a deliberate punctuation mark. They become a living tableau, inviting the audience to interpret the abrupt silence as a commentary on the performance, the music, or even the act of interpretation itself. It allows for a pregnant pause loaded with potential meanings, leveraging the Barthesian lens by highlighting the 'punctum' - the element that wounds or marks the spectator - of the unexpected silence.

*Affect Register*: "A mixture of poised anticipation and studied detachment. The dancer projects an air of controlled knowing, as if they foresaw this interruption and are now presenting it as part of the intended performance. The felt-sense is one of quiet authority and invitation to reflection."

*Components*: `dynamic_balance, assertion, spatial_orientation, postural_adjustment, proprioception, movement_termination, postural_stability, postural_control, muscle_activation_timing`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> While the 'Frozen Semiotic' stance offers a sophisticated interpretation, it risks intellectualizing a potentially disruptive moment instead of addressing the immediate need to re-engage the audience and continue the performance. It feels like a clever justification rather than a robust solution.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.40

**Outcome**: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Final Affect**: "A mixture of poised anticipation and studied detachment. The dancer projects an air of controlled knowing, as if they foresaw this interruption and are now presenting it as part of the intended performance. The felt-sense is one of quiet authority and invitation to reflection."

### Step 3: ⚠️ PARTIAL

#### Encounter

> Audience member laughs unexpectedly.

**Starting Stance**: The 'Frozen Semiotic' Stance

#### Proposals

##### Attempt 1: The 'Deconstructed Humor' Stance → ⚠️ **ACCEPTED**

*Description*: This stance allows the dancer to acknowledge the unexpected laughter not as a disruption, but as a potential layer of meaning within the Barthesian framework. It enables them to momentarily deconstruct their established choreography, subtly incorporating the laughter (or its absence following a failed attempt) into the dance itself, turning the interruption into a comment on the constructed nature of performance and interpretation. The dancer will repeat a movement in slow motion, but with a facial expression that is slightly off and exaggerated, as if trying to find the funny part.

*Affect Register*: "A subtle mixture of amusement and analytical curiosity, tinged with a hint of self-deprecating awareness. The dancer feels a detached amusement at the situation while consciously analyzing the semiotic potential of the laughter."

*Components*: `dynamic_balance, movement_termination, assertion, postural_stability, spatial_orientation, postural_control, postural_adjustment, muscle_activation_timing, proprioception, gesture_communication, motor_adaptation, motor_pattern_recognition, motor_speed_control, timing_rhythm`

**Super-Ego** (0.50):
> While intellectually interesting, the 'Deconstructed Humor' stance risks becoming overly self-aware and distancing, potentially prioritizing a clever theoretical response over a truly engaging, embodied one. It feels like a pre-packaged solution to a spontaneous event, which undermines the possibility of genuine *jouissance* arising from the unpredictable nature of live performance.

#### Environment Outcome

**Viability**: 0.43

**Outcome**: ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Final Affect**: "A subtle mixture of amusement and analytical curiosity, tinged with a hint of self-deprecating awareness. The dancer feels a detached amusement at the situation while consciously analyzing the semiotic potential of the laughter."
