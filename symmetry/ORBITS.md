## The D/A Plane

Rooms distribute across a **Dopamine × Acetylcholine intensity plane**:

```
                    High A (Focus/Attention)
                         ↑

## Wing Rotation Orbits

D₄ rotation relates rooms across wings. Position-equivalent rooms form orbits:

### Position 1 Orbit: The Entry

| Wing | Room | Function |
|------|------|----------|
| I | Crypt (001) | Total shutdown, sensory deprivation |
| II | Morning Chapel (013) | Setting trajectory, zero input |
| III | Cockpit (025) | God-mode execution |
| IV | Intersection (037) | Overwhelming input, watching the stream |

**Orbit structure**: From silence → intention → action → chaos → silence

### Position 3 Orbit: The Natural Ground

| Wing | Room | Function |
|------|------|----------|
| I | Garden (003) | Slow observation of nature |
| II | Map Room (015) | High-level strategy |
| III | Studio (027) | Deep creative synthesis |
| IV | Mosh Pit (039) | Aggression release |

**Orbit structure**: From nature → vision → creation → destruction → nature

### Position 6 Orbit: The Caretaker

| Wing | Room | Function |
|------|------|----------|
| I | Sick Bay (006) | Acknowledging fragility |
| II | Editor's Desk (018) | Polishing, cutting |
| III | Sprint (030) | Max output pressure |
| IV | Improv Stage (042) | Generative play |

**Orbit structure**: From care → refinement → production → play → care

### Position 12 Orbit: The Transition

| Wing | Room | Function |
|------|------|----------|
| I | Airlock (012) | Decompression between worlds |
| II | Vault (024) | Security, backups |
| III | Altar of Work (036) | Shipping, completion |
| IV | Void Active (048) | Staring into the abyss |

**Orbit structure**: From transition → security → completion → confrontation → transition

## Reflection Orbits

D₄ reflections relate rooms by axis-flip:

### Vertical Reflection (σᵥ): Swap D-levels

| Low D | High D | Shared A |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Crypt (001) | Intersection (037) | Low A |
| Garden (003) | Mosh Pit (039) | Low A |
| Morning Chapel (013) | Cockpit (025) | High A |
| Archive (014) | Forge (026) | High A |

### Horizontal Reflection (σₕ): Swap A-levels

| Low A | High A | Shared D |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Crypt (001) | Morning Chapel (013) | Low D |
| Swamp (010) | Classroom (021) | Low D |
| Intersection (037) | Cockpit (025) | High D |
| Casino (040) | Laboratory (031) | High D |

## Fixed Points

Rooms with **non-trivial stabilizers** (fixed under some group action):

### Forum (Wing V) — Center Fixed

| Room | Why Fixed |
|------|-----------|
| River (049) | Center of D/A plane, alone together |
| Salon (050) | Dialectic holds tension of opposites |
| Piazza (053) | Pure spectacle, all directions |

These rooms are **stable under rotation** because they occupy the balanced center.

### Observatory (Wing VI) — Meta Fixed

| Room | Why Fixed |
|------|-----------|
| Bridge (061) | Chooses the room — outside all quadrants |
| Camera Obscura (064) | Pure observation — not in the plane |
| Exit (072) | The door — transcends the system |

These rooms are **above the plane** — they govern but don't participate.

## Orbit Representatives

Each orbit has a **canonical representative** — the simplest member:

| Orbit | Representative | Other Members |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| The Silence | Crypt (001) | Morning Chapel, Cockpit, Intersection |
| The Ground | Garden (003) | Map Room, Studio, Mosh Pit |
| The Witness | Piazza (053) | Camera Obscura, River |
| The Portal | Airlock (012) | Vault, Altar, Void, Exit |
| The Fire | Forge (026) | War Room, Arena |
| The Water | Bath (002) | Nightclub, Sea dissolution |

---

## Orbit Transitions (Deterritorialization)

Movement between orbits corresponds to **Novelty Search** mode:

```
Current Orbit ──[trauma]──→ Destabilization ──[discovery]──→ New Orbit
```

### Example: Crypt to Cockpit

1. In **Crypt** (sensory deprivation, Low D, Low A)
2. **Trauma**: Urgency arrives, rest fails to restore
3. **Novelty Search**: Activate dormant high-D components
4. **New Orbit**: Enter **Cockpit** (execution, High D, High A)

The rooms are in the **same position-1 orbit** — the system traverses the orbit by rotation R₉₀.

### Example: Garden to Mosh Pit

1. In **Garden** (slow observation, Low D, Low A)
2. **Trauma**: Passive observation breeds stagnation
3. **Novelty Search**: Activate aggression, release
4. **New Orbit**: Enter **Mosh Pit** (collision, High D, Low A)

The rooms are in the **same position-3 orbit** — transformation by σᵥ (vertical reflection).

Wing V (Forum) and Wing VI (Observatory) are **off-plane** and have special orbit structures.
