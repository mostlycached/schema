# Symmetry Groups for Expanding Living Forms

> Use symmetry groups to expand set of living forms

---

## Core Thesis

Every **living form** in this system — seed, animism, stance, room — can be **transformed** by symmetry operations to generate new forms. What appears as fixed taxonomy is actually a **group action** on a space of possibilities.

**The expansion is not addition. It is multiplication through transformation.**

## The Four Integrations

| Direction | What It Does | Group |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Mathematical Grounding** | Define the symmetry operations | D₄ × Z₂ |
| **Ontological Expansion** | Generate seed variations | S₇ × D₈ |
| **Phenomenological Mapping** | Transform rooms into rooms | D₄ acting on D/A plane |
| **Deleuzian Integration** | Difference as group action | Difference = g·x - x ≠ 0 |

## The Fundamental Groups

### The Wing Group: D₄ (Dihedral Group of Order 8)

The 6 wings organize on a **D/A intensity plane**:

```
                    High A (Focus)
                         ↑
    II. Administration   |   III. Machine Shop
    (Low D, High A)      |   (High D, High A)
                         |
   ─────────────────────·+·───────────────────→ High D (Desire)
                         |
    I. Foundation        |   IV. Wilderness  
    (Low D, Low A)       |   (High D, Low A)
                         ↓
                    Low A
                    
    V. Forum = Center (Medium D, Medium A)
    VI. Observatory = Meta (Above the plane)
```

**Operations**:

| Symbol | Operation | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **R₉₀** | 90° rotation | Wing I → II → III → IV → I |
| **σᵥ** | Vertical reflection | Swap D-levels: I↔IV, II↔III |
| **σₕ** | Horizontal reflection | Swap A-levels: I↔II, III↔IV |
| **e** | Identity | Stay in current wing |

### The Animism Group: D₈

The 8 animisms form symmetries of an octagon:

```
           HEIGHT
          ╱     ╲
      FIRE       SEA
        │    ╳    │
        │    ╳    │
    KNIFE ─── + ─── JAW
        │    ╳    │
        │    ╳    │
    GRAVITY     NIGHT
          ╲     ╱
           EARTH
```

| Pair | Duality |
|------|---------|
| Height ↔ Gravity | Vertical axis |
| Fire ↔ Sea | Active destruction ↔ Passive dissolution |
| Knife ↔ Jaw | Cut ↔ Articulate |
| Night ↔ Earth | Surround ↔ Ground |

### The Mode Group: Z₂

Binary symmetry in stance dynamics:

| Element | Stance Mode |
|---------|-------------|
| **e** | Adoption (optimization) |
| **σ** | Novelty Search (trauma/discovery) |

Reflection σ swaps between modes: **Viability failure triggers σ**.

## Generators

### Seed Generator: Rotate Category

```
Category rotation: f(C) = C + 1 (mod 7)

Symbolic → Institutional → Event → Material → Spatial → Temporal → Relational → Symbolic
```

**Example**: "Reading Spinoza" (Symbolic/Book)  
→ Rotate → "Spinoza Reading Group" (Institutional/Collective)

### Seed Generator: Reflect Animism

```
Animism reflection: σ(A) = dual of A

Fire ↔ Sea | Height ↔ Gravity | Knife ↔ Jaw | Night ↔ Earth
```

**Example**: "Reading Spinoza" (Fire: immanence burning)  
→ Reflect → "Reading Spinoza until self dissolves" (Sea: oceanic merger)

### Room Generator: Wing Rotation

```
Room in Wing W at position P:
R₉₀(Room) = Room at same P in Wing (W + 1) mod 4
```

**Example**: "The Crypt" (Wing I, Position 1)  
→ R₉₀ → Equivalent room in Wing II = "The Morning Chapel"

Both are **first rooms** of their wing — but one is Low A (restore), the other High A (govern).

### Stance Generator: Mode Flip

```
If current Stance S has viability V(S, E) < threshold:
    σ(S) = Novelty Search state
    Deactivate core components
    Activate dormant components
    Emerge new Stance S'
```

## Room Orbit Structure

Rooms related by symmetry form **orbits**:

| Orbit Name | Member Rooms | Symmetry |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **The Descent** | Crypt, Void (Active), Silent Retreat | Confronting emptiness |
| **The Crucible** | Forge, War Room, Arena | High-stakes production |
| **The Witness** | Camera Obscura, Piazza, River | Observation without action |
| **The Portal** | Airlock, Exit, Bridge | Transition states |
| **The Ground** | Garden, Basecamp, Totem | Anchoring to materiality |

**Rooms within an orbit transform into each other under group action.**

---

## Deleuzian Integration

### Difference as Non-Identity Transformation

$$\text{Difference}(x) = g \cdot x - x$$

When g ≠ e (identity), the form differs from itself while remaining *that* form.

### Intensity as Distance from Orbit Center

Forms at orbit edge are **virtual/intensive** — ready to transform.  
Forms at orbit center are **actual/extensive** — stabilized.

### The BwO as Identity Element

The Body without Organs = **Night** (the permanent surround)
- It transforms nothing
- All forms pass through and return unchanged
- Yet it is the **condition of possibility** for transformation

### Deterritorialization = Orbit Jump

When σ (mode flip) is triggered:
1. Current orbit destabilizes
2. System explores adjacent orbits
3. Reterritorializes in new orbit

This is **Novelty Search** from the Stance-Component architecture.

---

## The Expansion Formula

Given any seed S with category C and animism A:

$$\text{Orbit}(S) = \{g \cdot S : g \in S_7 \times D_8\}$$

This generates up to **56 potential variations** from a single seed.

Given any room R in wing W:

$$\text{Orbit}(R) = \{g \cdot R : g \in D_4\}$$

This generates **4 related rooms** across the D/A quadrants.

## Summary

| Structure | Group | Generator | Output |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Seeds | S₇ × D₈ | Rotate category, Reflect animism | 56x expansion |
| Rooms | D₄ | Wing rotation, Axis reflection | 4 related rooms |
| Stances | Z₂ | Mode flip | Alternate stance |
| Animisms | D₈ | Reflection across duality | Dual animism |

**The living forms are not fixed. They are orbits under transformation.**
