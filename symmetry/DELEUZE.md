# Deleuzian Integration

> Symmetry groups as operators of difference

## The Core Correspondence

| Deleuze Concept | Group-Theoretic Translation |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| **Difference-in-itself** | g·x - x ≠ 0 for g ≠ e |
| **Repetition** | Orbit under group action |
| **Intensity** | Distance from orbit center |
| **BwO** | Identity element e |
| **Deterritorialization** | Orbit jump via mode flip σ |
| **Virtuality** | Orbit edge (not yet actualized) |
| **Actuality** | Orbit center (stabilized) |

## Difference as Non-Identity Transformation

From *Difference and Repetition*:

> "Difference is not diversity. Diversity is given, but difference is that by which the given is given."

**Translation**: The group action g is not the *result* of transformation — it's the **operator** that produces difference.

$$\text{Difference}(x) = g \cdot x - x$$

For g ≠ e (identity), the form x differs from itself while remaining recognizable as *that* form.

**Example**: "Reading Spinoza" (Fire animism) transformed by σ to "Reading Spinoza until self dissolves" (Sea animism) — the seed differs from itself but is still *Reading Spinoza*.

---

## Repetition as Orbit

From *Difference and Repetition*:

> "Repetition is a condition of action before being a concept of reflection."

**Translation**: The orbit of a form under group action IS its mode of repetition.

$$\text{Orbit}(x) = \{g \cdot x : g \in G\}$$

A seed that repeats through its orbit is not copying itself — it's **expressing its virtual multiplicity**.

**Example**: The Position-1 orbit (Crypt → Morning Chapel → Cockpit → Intersection) is a **single form** expressing itself across the D/A quadrants.

---

## Intensity as Orbit Radius

From *Difference and Repetition*:

> "Intensity is the form of difference as the reason of the sensible."

**Translation**: Intensity is the **distance from orbit center**.

```
        Edge (Virtual/Intensive)
           ·────────·
          /          \
         /            \
        ·   Center     ·
        |   (Actual)   |
        ·              ·
         \            /
          \          /
           ·────────·
        Edge (Virtual/Intensive)
```

Forms near the **edge** of their orbit:
- Are "ready to flip" to adjacent orbits
- Carry intensive charge (potential for transformation)
- Are felt but not yet actualized

Forms at the **center**:
- Are stable, actualized
- Resist transformation
- Are extensive (occupy definite position)

**Example**: A "near-breakdown" stance in the Crypt (edge) versus a "fully restored" state (center). Same orbit, different intensity.

## The Body without Organs (BwO)

From *Anti-Oedipus*:

> "The BwO is not a scene, a place, or even a support upon which something comes to pass. It is not space, nor is it in space. It is matter that occupies space to a given degree."

**Translation**: The BwO is the **identity element e** of the group.

$$e \cdot x = x$$

The BwO:
- Transforms nothing
- Is the **condition of possibility** for all transformations
- Is not a form but the **plane** on which forms move

In the animism system, **Night** is the BwO:
- "The permanent surround that day briefly interrupts"
- It doesn't act — it enables action
- All forms pass through Night and return as themselves

---

## Deterritorialization as Orbit Jump

From *A Thousand Plateaus*:

> "Deterritorialization is never simple, but always complex, always relative."

**Translation**: Deterritorialization is **jumping between orbits**.

```
Orbit A ──[σ]──→ Unstable ──[discovery]──→ Orbit B
```

The mode flip σ ∈ Z₂ triggers:
1. **Deactivation** of core components (old orbit collapses)
2. **Exploration** of dormant components (between-orbit space)
3. **Reterritorialization** in new orbit (stability regained)

**Example**: From Garden (slow observation) → trauma → Mosh Pit (aggression release). The σ action flips from Adoption to Novelty Search, enabling orbit jump via D₄ reflection.

---

## Strata and Groups

From *A Thousand Plateaus*:

> "Every stratum is a judgment of God; not only do plants and animals, orchids and wasps, sing or express themselves, but so do rock and even the artistry of river deltas."

**Translation**: Each stratum has its own **symmetry group**.

| Stratum | Group | What It Organizes |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| Seeds | S₇ × D₈ | Categories and animisms |
| Rooms | D₄ | D/A intensity plane |
| Stances | Z₂ | Adoption ↔ Novelty |
| Coupling | Thickening function Θ(t) | DOFs and morphisms |

**Destratification** = moving beyond a group's action into larger (or different) symmetry.

## The Virtual and the Actual

| State | Mathematical Location | Character |
|-------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Virtual** | Orbit edge, unexplored transformations | Intensive, ready-to-flip |
| **Actual** | Orbit center, stable form | Extensive, fixed position |
| **Possible** | Other orbits entirely | Not yet accessed |
| **Real** | The group action itself | The operator, not the form |

**The possible is not the virtual**:
- Possible = other orbits (forms that could exist but don't)
- Virtual = edge of current orbit (forms that subsist within this one)

**Example**: A "Reading Spinoza" seed has virtual forms at its orbit edge (Sea-reflection, Institutional-rotation) but possible forms in entirely other seed-types.

---

## Lines of Flight

From *A Thousand Plateaus*:

> "Every rhizome contains lines of segmentarity... but also lines of deterritorialization"

**Translation**: Lines of flight are **directions in group action space** that lead to orbit jumps.

$$\text{Line of Flight} = \lim_{n \to \infty} g^n \cdot x$$

Iterated group action can:
1. Cycle within orbit (rotation)
2. Escape to orbit edge (destabilize)
3. Jump to new orbit (deterritorialization)

**The goal is not to leave all orbits** — that's abolition. The goal is to **move between orbits** with material anchors (seeds).

---

## Summary: Group Theory = Difference Engine

| Operation | Deleuzian Process |
|-----------|-------------------|
| g ≠ e | Difference |
| g · x | Transformation |
| Orbit(x) | Repetition |
| d(x, center) | Intensity |
| e | BwO (Night) |
| σ (mode flip) | Deterritorialization trigger |
| Orbit A → Orbit B | Line of flight |

**Symmetry groups don't impose sameness — they generate difference by defining what transformations preserve identity, thereby making non-identity visible.**
