# Alternative Ontologies and Their Symmetry Breaks

> Different ontological frameworks generate different symmetry structures — and different ways of breaking them.

---

## The Pattern

Every ontology has:
1. **Primitives** — What exists fundamentally
2. **Relations** — How primitives connect
3. **Symmetries** — What transformations preserve structure
4. **Breaks** — What transformations destroy structure

---

## I. Process Ontology (Whitehead)

### Primitives
- **Actual occasions** — momentary experiential events
- **Eternal objects** — pure potentials (forms, qualities)
- **Prehension** — how occasions grasp other occasions

### Symmetries

| Group | Acts On | Preserves |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Causal inheritance** | Occasion → Occasion | Temporal ordering |
| **Concrescence** | Eternal objects → Actual occasion | Unity of experience |
| **Nexus formation** | Occasions → Societies | Pattern persistence |

### Symmetry Breaks

| Break | What It Violates | What Emerges |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| **Reverse prehension** | Future occasions grasping past | Retrocausality |
| **Eternal object collision** | Objects ingress separately | Qualities that fuse |
| **Nexus rupture** | Societies persist | Societies that die mid-process |
| **Self-prehension** | Occasion can't grasp itself | Strange loops, consciousness |

---

## II. Object-Oriented Ontology (Harman)

### Primitives
- **Objects** — withdrawn, never fully accessed
- **Qualities** — sensual surface of objects
- **Allure** — when real object glimpsed through qualities

### Symmetries

| Group | Acts On | Preserves |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Withdrawal** | Object → Object | Inexhaustibility |
| **Vicarious causation** | Object₁ → Sensual Object₂ | Indirectness |
| **Undermining/Overmining** | Object → Parts/Effects | Object integrity |

### Symmetry Breaks

| Break | What It Violates | What Emerges |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| **Direct access** | All access is indirect | Mystical union, tool breakdown |
| **Object exhaustion** | Objects are inexhaustible | The object fully known (death) |
| **Quality-object fusion** | Qualities ≠ Real object | Object that IS its qualities |
| **Allure permanence** | Allure is momentary | Sustained glimpse of the real |

## III. Assemblage Ontology (DeLanda/Deleuze)

### Primitives
- **Components** — heterogeneous parts
- **Relations of exteriority** — parts can detach and reattach
- **Capacities** — what components can do
- **Coding/Territorialization** — how assemblages stabilize

### Symmetries

| Group | Acts On | Preserves |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Scaling** | Micro-assemblage ↔ Macro | Self-similarity |
| **Deterritorialization** | Coded → Decoded | Potential for recoding |
| **Component exchange** | Part₁ ↔ Part₂ | Assemblage function |

### Symmetry Breaks

| Break | What It Violates | What Emerges |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| **Internal relation** | All relations are external | Component that can't detach |
| **Capacity overflow** | Capacities are finite | Infinite capacity (God-component) |
| **Scale collapse** | Levels are distinct | Micro directly = Macro |
| **Permanent deterritorialization** | Eventually recodes | Pure line of flight (abolition) |

## IV. Enactivist Ontology (Varela/Thompson)

### Primitives
- **Autopoiesis** — self-making, self-maintaining systems
- **Structural coupling** — system-environment co-determination
- **Sense-making** — meaning emerges from coupling
- **Embodiment** — cognition is bodily

### Symmetries

| Group | Acts On | Preserves |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Operational closure** | System interior | Identity boundary |
| **Coupling reciprocity** | System ↔ Environment | Mutual specification |
| **Sensorimotor invariants** | Action ↔ Perception | Enacted world |

### Symmetry Breaks

| Break | What It Violates | What Emerges |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| **Boundary dissolution** | Autopoiesis requires boundary | System merging with environment |
| **Asymmetric coupling** | Coupling is reciprocal | Domination/parasitism |
| **Sensorimotor rupture** | Action/perception are coupled | Pure perception without action |
| **Disembodied cognition** | All cognition is bodily | Thought without body |

---

## V. Actor-Network Theory (Latour)

### Primitives
- **Actants** — human and non-human actors
- **Networks** — associations between actants
- **Translation** — how actants modify each other
- **Black boxes** — stabilized networks treated as single actant

### Symmetries

| Group | Acts On | Preserves |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Generalized symmetry** | Human ↔ Non-human | No ontological privilege |
| **Translation chains** | Actant₁ → Actant₂ → ... | Network coherence |
| **Black-boxing** | Network → Single actant | Functional equivalence |

### Symmetry Breaks

| Break | What It Violates | What Emerges |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| **Asymmetric attribution** | Humans = Non-humans | Human exceptionalism / Panpsychism |
| **Translation failure** | Networks persist through translation | Complete breakdown, incommensurability |
| **Permanent opening** | Black boxes can close | Eternally unstable network |
| **Actant without network** | Actants are network effects | Solitary existence |

## VI. Trinitarian Ontology (Christian Metaphysics)

### Primitives
- **Persons** — Father, Son, Spirit (distinct but not separate)
- **Essence** — shared divine nature
- **Perichoresis** — mutual indwelling
- **Procession** — eternal relations of origin

### Symmetries

| Group | Acts On | Preserves |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Circumincession** | Person ↔ Person ↔ Person | Unity in distinction |
| **Economic/Immanent** | Trinity in history ↔ Eternal Trinity | Identity of action and being |
| **Appropriation** | Works → Persons | Unity of external works |

### Symmetry Breaks

| Break | What It Violates | What Emerges |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| **Modalism** | Persons are distinct | One person, three masks |
| **Subordinationism** | Persons are equal | Hierarchy in the Godhead |
| **Quaternity** | Three and only three | Fourth person (creation as God?) |
| **Isolation** | Perichoresis is complete | Person without indwelling |

## VII. Buddhist Dependent Origination

### Primitives
- **Dharmas** — momentary phenomena
- **Pratītyasamutpāda** — dependent co-arising
- **Śūnyatā** — emptiness (no inherent existence)
- **Two truths** — conventional and ultimate

### Symmetries

| Group | Acts On | Preserves |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Conditionality** | Dharma → Dharma | Causal web |
| **Two-truth correspondence** | Conventional ↔ Ultimate | Each valid in its domain |
| **Emptiness universality** | All dharmas | Nothing has svabhāva |

### Symmetry Breaks

| Break | What It Violates | What Emerges |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| **Svabhāva-vāda** | All is empty | Something has inherent existence |
| **Unconditioned arising** | All arises dependently | Spontaneous generation |
| **Truth collapse** | Two truths distinct | Conventional IS ultimate |
| **Dharma perdurance** | Dharmas are momentary | Dharma that persists |

## VIII. Spinozan Substance Monism

### Primitives
- **Substance** — one, infinite, self-caused
- **Attributes** — infinite expressions (we know Thought, Extension)
- **Modes** — finite modifications of attributes
- **Conatus** — striving to persist in being

### Symmetries

| Group | Acts On | Preserves |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Attribute parallelism** | Thought ↔ Extension | Same order in both |
| **Modal determination** | Mode → Mode → ... | Causal necessity |
| **Conatus conservation** | Mode over time | Power of existence |

### Symmetry Breaks

| Break | What It Violates | What Emerges |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| **Attribute interaction** | Attributes never cross | Mind causing body |
| **Modal freedom** | All modes are determined | Genuine contingency |
| **Conatus reversal** | All strives to persist | Drive toward self-destruction |
| **Substance plurality** | Only one substance | Multiple infinites |

---

## Cross-Ontology Pattern

Every ontology:
1. Defines **what persists** (substance, process, object, network...)
2. Defines **what relates** (causation, prehension, translation...)
3. **Symmetries = structure-preserving operations on these**
4. **Breaks = violations that either destroy or generate**

| Ontology | Core Symmetry | Core Break |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Process | Temporal order | Retrocausality |
| OOO | Withdrawal | Direct access |
| Assemblage | Exteriority | Internal relation |
| Enactivism | Closure | Boundary dissolution |
| ANT | Human/Non-human symmetry | Asymmetric attribution |
| Trinitarian | Perichoresis | Person isolation |
| Buddhist | Emptiness | Inherent existence |
| Spinozan | Parallelism | Attribute interaction |

## Generating Your Breaks

To find symmetry breaks for any ontology:

1. **Identify the forbidden** — What does this ontology say cannot happen?
2. **Violate it** — Imagine that forbidden thing occurring
3. **Observe what emerges** — A new form, a destruction, or a new symmetry

**The breaks are always already there** — defined negatively by what the symmetry preserves.
