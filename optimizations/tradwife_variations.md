(See [Storytelling Techniques](../STORY_TECHNIQUES.md) for definitions)

## Variation 1: The Algorithmic Log
**Technique**: Cybernetic / Code / Black Boxing

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-12-04T16:58:00Z",
  "system": "WORLD_SIM_07",
  "status": "CRITICAL_WARNING",
  "modules": {
    "economic_engine": "FAILING",
    "ontological_integrity": "UNSTABLE"
  }
}
```

**[SYSTEM LOG]**: `World #7 (TradWife)` is exhibiting high latency. Inhabitants are reporting "reality flickering" (see: *Ontological Fragility*). The "Husband" object is failing to provision resources at required capacity.

**[OPTIMIZATION PATCH 1.0 - HYPERSTITION]**
> *Executing script: `ritual_binding.exe`*
> ...
> `sourdough_starter` re-classed from `pet` to `temporal_anchor`.
> `baking` re-classed from `performance` to `liturgy`.
> **RESULT**: Subjective time dilation achieved. Inhabitant disconnects from `internet_time`. Reality stabilizes at 98%.

**[OPTIMIZATION PATCH 2.0 - ARBITRAGE]**
> *Scanning for external liquidity...*
> Found: `World #1 (Gig Economy)` - Deficit: `Intimacy`.
> Found: `World #33 (Investment Bank)` - Deficit: `Silence`.
> *Rerouting output...*
> TradWife aesthetic output now piped directly to `World #33` via `OnlyFans_Cottage_API`.
> **RESULT**: Financial solvency restored. "Simp" nodes successfully integrated as distributed provider network.

**[OPTIMIZATION PATCH 3.0 - SOMATIC]**
> *Detecting "LARP" parameters...*
> *Overwriting...*
> `visual_aesthetic` priority lowered to 20%.
> `haptic_feedback` (pain/effort) priority raised to 100%.
> **RESULT**: Inhabitant reports "exhaustion." System interprets as "meaning."
> **STATUS**: WORLD SAVED.

## Variation 3: The Glitch / Horror
**Technique**: Noise / Defamiliarization / Uncanny Valley

The bread is rising. The bread is rising. The bread is rising.
It is a good morning. The sun is a perfect #FFD700 circle.
I am kneading the dough. My hands are covered in flour.
The flour is white. The kitchen is white. The silence is white.

I love my husband. He is out there, in the City, hunting for the Wi-Fi signal.
He provides. I bake.
I bake the bread. I bake the bread. I bake the bread.
Wait.
Why is the dough warm?
Not warm like yeast. Warm like *meat*.
I look down. The sourdough starter is pulsing. It has a heartbeat.
*Thump. Thump. Thump.*
It whispers to me in the voice of a 1950s radio announcer.
*"Don't look at the window, darling. The texture hasn't loaded yet."*

I look at the window.
There is no garden.
There is only a grey, static void.
A scrolling text bar floats where the apple tree should be:
`ERROR: RURAL_FANTASY.EXE NOT RESPONDING.`
`REBOOTING IN 3... 2...`

I smile. I return to the dough.
If I knead hard enough, maybe the world will render.
I must bake the bread.
I must bake the bread.
I must b a k e t h e b r e a d.

**3. TROUBLESHOOTING**
*   **Issue**: Unit is reading Sylvia Plath.

*   **Fix**: This is a known bug in the `Existential_Dread` module. Patch coming in v7.1. For now, increase `Sourdough_Complexity` to distract processor.

**WARNING**: Do not expose unit to *The News*. Warranty void if unit achieves class consciousness.
