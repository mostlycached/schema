Based on the "72 Adjacent Rooms" document in your Drive, I have captured the design and structured it into a Markdown format below.

# [cite_start]72 Adjacent Pleasure+ Rooms [cite: 1]

## Core Principles
* **The 5 Pillars:** Only 5 - Imagination, Building, Discovery, Being, History.
* **Spirit:** Every room has a fire/imago/spirit. For Being or Seeking.
* **Craft vs. Being:** That is what craft (Calvino) hones, Being (Barthes) hearths.
* **Desire:** For every Desire, a room in solitude and in social. A brown man, lost in a white world.
    * Poetry, Music, Dance, Dinner, Nature.
    * Perception, ontological, material discovery.

## Room Composition (The 72)
* **36 rooms to bend**
* **36 rooms to compose**
* **36 rooms to attend to but not participate with wisdom**
* *Note: All with patient craft.*

## The Pleasure Mechanism
* **Definition:** Only Pleasure - whatever brings it, trace its appearance and disappearance and write up something that lets people follow it. Pleasure needs no marketing. Pleasure makes no apology.
* **Valuation:** A valuation system that is subjectively vetted, not pushed down by X.
* **Possible Sources:** Order, Anxiety, Post, Enclosement, Path, Horizon, Ignorance, Repetition, Food, Mobility, Power, Erotic uncertainty, Material play, Nature mirror, Serendipity following, Anchor expansion.
* **Process:** Once traced, package it in a room and register in [World Tracker], make a song, journal, tune and publish.

## The World Manifold
* The World exists as a manifold, with worlds as flat pockets there.
* **Navigation:** Methods of navigation and leaps as means of introducing non-linearity to increase coverage not globally (that is messianic delusion of being Everything), but in the context of a trajectories’ qualitative exposure.
* **Priors:** Subjective (biological needs and values) and objective (inter-subjective and geographical).

## Project Rationale
* Built on a fundamental instinctual belief of **constructibility of a room** as a means of response via curiosity and fear.
* **Tools:** Makes use of a lookup index of methods as its primary tool. Senses the possibility of an LLM to perform both lookup and (recursive) application of these methods to materialize the alternatives.
* **Materiality:** The understanding that material and social possibilities still lie outside of its current toolset (which a King or a Seducer would have).

## Perceptual Modes (Pre-affect)
* Error, sinking, height, gravity, collision, darkness, temporal juxtaposition, fracture, symmetry, loop, window, mediation, digestive, entailment gaps, lack of forward projection, revisit.
* **Drug induced:** Coffee jitteriness, weed daydream diffusion, shroom TB.
* **Music induced:** Harmony dread.
* *Note: These are not foreseeable in current generative models outside of empirical trials.*

## History of Rooms
* **Mobility as Destiny:** We are born into a flat room, and then thrown into a spiky room. We move with fear, find another flat room, earning pleasure in the movement along the way.
* **Two Pleasures:** One that seeks movement and another for the womb.
* **Spectator Vision:** Must be seen as simulation or retrospection pleasures foretelling future pleasures.

## Adjacent Possible Rooms
* **Concept:** Adjacent possible alludes to distance.
* **Principles:**
    * False possible adjacency leads to premature closure.
    * Rooms as a necessary node definition. Spirit of the room as a necessary variable for a partial hypothesis.
    * Rooms with exterior permeability vs. rooms closed (fear vs. hunger tradeoff).
    * Craft vs. Destiny stands as principle against metaphysics.
    * Adjacency indexing stands as principle against premature Destiny closure.
    * Room’s room to grow stands against niche trinkets. Room exteriority against solipsistic expansion.
* **Metaphors:**
    * Midnight bookstore as Index metaphor. Inaccessibility expressed as “staff picks”.
    * Block parties as metaphor for far index navigation vs. room doors as close index furthering.
* **Signals:**
    * Crisis as portal to distant rooms.
    * Fantasies (zombies, superheroes) as following a trajectory of possibility.
    * Tension as a distinguishing signal on multiple POSSIBLES pushing out of the window.
    * Repetition without difference across Desire coverage dimensions as a signal for departure.

## Agent Architecture
`Room Interrogator` -> `Room expander / neighboring Room generator` -> `Room affordance helper`

## Critique of Non-Neighbors
* **Too big a delta:** Superhero discourse (wish fulfillment rather than change).
* **Non-historical:** Relevant once upon a time, but method has been co-opted.
* **Non-class specific:** Applicable to a group of people, but not others.
* **Non-language:** The discourse has no legibility, but pretends to.
* **Imported assumptions:** One good form importing incorrect further assumptions.
