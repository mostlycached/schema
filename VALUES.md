# Value Systems for World Optimization

This document enumerates various value systems that can be used to "optimize" the sociological and phenomenological worlds defined in `WORLDS.md`. These systems provide criteria—both "hard" (quantitative, structural) and "soft" (qualitative, experiential)—for evaluating the health, success, or desirability of a given World.

## 1. Phenomenological Criteria (Soft)
*Focus: The subjective experience of the inhabitant.*

*   **Flow State**: The frequency and depth of optimal experience where self-consciousness dissolves (e.g., The Speedrunner, The Surgeon).
*   **Meaning/Purpose**: The clarity and stability of the "Why" behind action (e.g., The Monastic Order, The Revolutionary Cell).
*   **Ontological Security**: The stability of the inhabitant's sense of reality and self (e.g., The Amish Community vs. The Schizophrenic Ward).
*   **Intersubjectivity**: The depth of shared understanding and empathy between inhabitants (e.g., The Family vs. The Commuter Train).
*   **Aesthetic Delight**: The frequency of beauty or sublime experiences (e.g., The Art Gallery, The Wilderness).

## 2. Economical Criteria (Hard)
*Focus: Resource allocation, efficiency, and growth.*

*   **Capital Accumulation**: The rate of growth of the dominant form of capital (financial, social, cultural) (e.g., The Investment Bank).
*   **Efficiency**: The ratio of output to input; minimization of waste (e.g., The Factory, The Algorithm).
*   **Scalability**: The ability of the world to expand without collapsing its core functions (e.g., The Franchise, The Viral Trend).
*   **Liquidity**: The ease with which value can be exchanged or converted (e.g., The Crypto Market).
*   **Sustainability**: The long-term viability of resource consumption rates (e.g., The Permaculture Farm vs. The Strip Mine).

## 3. Systemic Criteria (Hard/Soft)
*Focus: The functional integrity and survival of the system (Luhmann).*

*   **Autopoiesis**: The system's ability to reproduce itself and maintain its boundary against the environment.
*   **Resilience**: The capacity to absorb shocks and adapt without breaking (e.g., The Decentralized Network).
*   **Complexity**: The internal differentiation and sophistication of the system's operations.
*   **Coherence**: The alignment between the system's function and its internal logic (Binary Code).
*   **Homeostasis**: The ability to maintain stable internal conditions despite external volatility.

## 4. Aesthetic Criteria (Soft)
*Focus: Form, style, and sensory coherence.*

*   **Stylistic Consistency**: The degree to which all elements of the world reinforce a unified aesthetic (e.g., The Wes Anderson Movie, The Gothic Cathedral).
*   **Novelty**: The production of new and surprising forms or sensations (e.g., The Avant-Garde).
*   **Sublimity**: The capacity to evoke awe or terror through scale or intensity (e.g., The Mountaineering Expedition).
*   **Narrative Arc**: The satisfying structure of the collective story being told (e.g., The Hero's Journey).

## 5. Ethical Criteria (Soft)
*Focus: Morality, justice, and the good.*

*   **Justice/Fairness**: The equitable distribution of capital and power (e.g., The Cooperative).
*   **Virtue**: The cultivation of specific character traits deemed good (e.g., The Stoic School).
*   **Harm Reduction**: The minimization of suffering for inhabitants (e.g., The Hospital).
*   **Liberty**: The maximization of individual agency and choice (e.g., The Open Frontier).

## 6. Epistemic Criteria (Hard)
*Focus: Truth, knowledge, and information.*

*   **Accuracy**: The correspondence between the world's internal map and external reality (e.g., The Science Lab).
*   **Predictive Power**: The ability to foresee future states based on current data (e.g., The Prediction Market).
*   **Information Density**: The amount of non-redundant information processed per unit of time.
*   **Falsifiability**: The openness of the world's core truths to testing and revision.

## 7. Nietzschean Critique (Transvaluation)
*Focus: The origin and life-affirming nature of values.*

*   **Life-Affirmation**: Does the system say "Yes" to life, struggle, and becoming, or does it seek to escape them (Nihilism)?
*   **Master vs. Slave Morality**: Do the values originate from an overflow of strength and self-affirmation (Master), or from resentment towards the strong (Slave)?
*   **Will to Power**: Does the system enhance the feeling of power, the will to power, and power itself in man?
*   **Creativity/Transvaluation**: Does the system have the capacity to create new values, or is it trapped in the preservation of old ones?

## 8. Psychoanalytic & Post-Structuralist Criteria (Desire)
*Focus: The economy of desire, pleasure, and the limits of symbolization.*

*   **Pleasure (Plaisir) vs. Bliss (Jouissance)**: Does the world offer comfortable, cultural enjoyment (Plaisir) or a disruptive, ecstatic loss of self that transcends the social code (Jouissance)? (Barthes)
*   **The Lack (Manque)**: Does the world acknowledge the fundamental void driving desire, or does it attempt to fill it with fantasy objects? (Lacan)
*   **The Real**: Does the system encounter that which resists symbolization—the traumatic, unrepresentable truth—or does it successfully repress it?
*   **Eros vs. Thanatos**: Is the world driven by the binding, life-preserving instincts (Eros) or the compulsion towards dissolution and repetition (Death Drive)? (Freud)
