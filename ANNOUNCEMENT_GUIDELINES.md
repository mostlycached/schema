# Audiobook Announcement Guidelines

This document defines the structure and content requirements for audiobook release announcements on the Hyperframes site.

## Purpose

Audiobook announcements should provide **depth and context** rather than generic marketing copy. Each announcement should help readers understand the conceptual framework, methodology, and specific variations within the project.

## Required Structure

### 1. Opening Section
- Brief introduction of the album title and availability
- High-level concept in 1-2 sentences

### 2. The Seed / Source Material
**What to include:**
- The original "world" or scenario that was used as the seed
- Source texts, philosophical frameworks, or conceptual starting points
- Why this particular seed was chosen

**Example:**
> This project began with philosophical readings from Michel Serres' *The Five Senses*, Christopher Alexander's *The Nature of Order*, and Georges Didi-Huberman's *The Man Who Walked Through Walls*...

### 3. The Lenses / Analytical Frameworks
**What to include:**
- The theoretical frameworks applied (Schutz phenomenology, Bourdieu structure, Luhmann systems, etc.)
- How these lenses intersect or create a "Venn diagram" of perspectives
- The analytical dimensions explored (stance, temporality, ontology, etc.)

**Example:**
> Each variation applies different lenses from phenomenology, systems theory, and structural analysis—creating overlapping perspectives that reveal insights only visible at their intersections.

### 4. The Variations / Transformations
**What to include:**
- Overview of the variation techniques used
- The range of perspectives or stances explored
- How the source material was transformed

**Example:**
> The variations range from first-person embodied experience to third-person systemic analysis, from present-tense phenomenology to speculative futures.

### 5. Deep Dives on 2-3 Tracks
**What to include for each highlighted track:**
- Track title and number
- The specific variation applied
- What makes this track conceptually interesting
- How it differs from the source material
- Musical aesthetic and why it matches the content

**Example:**
> **Track 3: "Serres Method"** — This variation takes Serres' embodied climbing meditation and reframes it through a methodological lens, asking "what if this experience were a research protocol?" The narrative shifts from sensory immediacy to systematic observation, transforming tactile presence into measured data. The blues rock intro becomes more structured and rhythmic, mirroring this methodological turn.

### 6. Track Listing with Brief Descriptions
- List all remaining tracks (not covered in deep dives)
- One-line description per track indicating the variation or perspective
- Keep descriptions concise but specific

**Example:**
> **Track 4: "Reading Fractal"** — Alexander's wholeness explored through recursive self-similarity  
> **Track 5: "Writing as Alexander"** — Second-person narration positioning the reader as architect

### 7. Musical Approach
- Overall aesthetic choices
- How music relates to conceptual framework
- Specific musical techniques or styles used

### 8. Listen Now / Embedded Player
- Bandcamp link
- Embedded iframe player
- Repository location (if relevant)

## Writing Style

### Do:
- ✅ Use specific philosophical terminology where appropriate
- ✅ Explain the "why" behind variation choices
- ✅ Provide concrete examples from tracks
- ✅ Show how techniques transform the source material
- ✅ Make conceptual connections explicit

### Don't:
- ❌ Use vague marketing language ("stunning," "innovative," "groundbreaking")
- ❌ Describe tracks as just "different takes" without explaining how
- ❌ Assume readers know the theoretical frameworks
- ❌ Skip the methodology to focus only on results

## Notes

- **Depth over brevity**: These announcements serve as documentation, not just marketing
- **Conceptual clarity**: Readers should understand the methodology even if they haven't read the source texts
- **Specificity**: Concrete examples beat abstract claims
- **Integration**: Connect each project back to the broader Hyperframes research framework
